2. **Create a ""launching pad""**: Designate a specific spot, like a bowl or tray, to keep keys, wallet, and other essential items to keep them organized and within reach.
3. **Reframe challenges**: View ADHD as a part of your identity, but not something that defines you. Focus on your strengths and abilities.
4. **Stay patient and persistent**: Managing ADHD is a process that takes time, effort, and patience. Don't be too hard on yourself when faced with setbacks.
5. **Seek accommodations**: In school, work, or personal settings, advocate for accommodations to help you succeed, such as extra time to complete tasks or the use of a planner.
