That’s 95% of what it takes to succeed in college. \n\nThen, when you enter the real world, it has virtually nothing to do with how well you did in school. If you’re adequately challenged and rewarded, you’ll want to work hard, if not, you won’t. Being in the professional world for 4 years has shown me that effort doesn’t have much to do with business. Most of the time, you can finish your work in a half day; it’s what you do after you finish that work that defines your success.

It makes no sense that k-12 is like being a toddler the whole trip and you suddenly got to become an adult the day you go to college."", ""I have noticed an interesting trend, that's led me to wonder, if anybody else has observed anything similar? I'll begin with a discussion about sports, including school and club athletics. Growing up, I played my fair share of sports (wrestling, basketball, football, track, & baseball), throughout different periods of my past adolescent life. One thing I have always observed, no matter the activity, is that when an individual begins a sport at an early age, either willing or by force, they are more likely to become burnt out. By burnt out, I mean the individual usually loses interest in the sport and grows tired of what the activity has or use to offer. As a result of this, at an older age, the individual no longer possesses the same interest towards the sport and overall, leans more towards abandoning it all together. Or possibly the individual become complacent, leading to little desire or willingness to better themselves. \n\nNow back to college, if there's another trend, possibly relating to the above observation, that I have personally witnessed at the beginning and throughout my college career, is that people become academically burnt out or complacent. In high school, I graduated with a 2.8 gpa, pretty impressive right ;) Little care for homework, lack of parental pressure, and an overall semi interest in school all together, led to my less than impressive finish. I now have finished my bachelors in Bio. & minor in Chem., with a 3.7 gpa, and I am currently applying to med school :) As for a majority of the kids I knew in high school that excelled academically, they either dropped out of college after a semester or two, didn't have a desire to attend college other than to party, or believed that their high school achievements would effortlessly translate to college success. Now, I believe that many of these kids were pushed by their parents and held to a higher standard of expected academic success, thus leading to them becoming burnt out overtime. I think it's easier to become interested and experience early on success, when introduced to a newly found focus in one's life. In addition, this obviously does not apply to every case,  and I personally know a few kids that experienced success in high school as well as in college. It just seems that the trend, is less in favor, of the transfer of success and/or interest from high school to college. Anybody have any thoughts relating to my observation or differing views?
