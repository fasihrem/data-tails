1,new,Music,one shot packs for creating a sound,"There are increasingly unique sounds coming onto the market for music production, yet many things still sound the same because I believe people are afraid to try something new, or there is a lack of interest in listening to music with ""different"" sounds or ""more extraordinary"" sounds. But that is the beauty of music: extraordinary sounds create music that is good for listeners, and diverse sounds can reach the mainstream or at least gain recognition.

2,new,Music,Working my way through the NME and Rolling Stone current Top 100 Albums. ,"Hello,  
I just wanted to share my little project with somebody, anybody.

So I checked the Top 100 albums according to NME and Rolling Stone Magazine.  
I compared those lists, they currently share 35 albums that they both agree should be in the top 100.

I am making my way through the shared 35 albums, then will listen to the remaining 65 on each list.

Naturally there are many albums on both lists that I have listened to/regularly listen to/am familiar with, but I am enjoying my little project nonetheless.

Have you ever under taken something similar?

If Linkin Park had changed their name, let’s say to “XERO”, they would be billed as “XERO (Formerly Linkin Park) across all promotional billings all over the world, so changing the name is kind of pointless. I doubt Mike Shinoda is hard up for the cash. Also… a cursory search online will show that Jamie has been having some mental health issues of his own that has negatively affected his relationships (at least from his perspective). I’ve long since said that Chester Bennington was the Kurt Cobain of his generation, and the toxic obsession and conspiracies surrounding Chester’s life and death and his loved ones only further solidifies this point. I said in a recent post that we don’t have all the facts and until Emily gives us some reason to be suspect of her, I think the sold out shows are proof LP fans have accepted her.

19,top,Music,The FCC is about to kill net neutrality. We’re protesting nationwide on Dec 7th to stop them.,"**tldr: The FCC is about to kill net neutrality. We’re protesting nationwide on Dec 7th to stop them.
Head over to http://www.verizonprotests.com/ for more info.**

**WHAT’S HAPPENING?**
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) just [announced](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20171120/11253438653/fcc-plan-to-use-thanksgiving-to-hide-attack-net-neutrality-vastly-underestimates-looming-backlash.shtml) its plan to slash net neutrality rules, allowing ISPs like Verizon to block apps, slow websites, and charge fees to control what you see & do online. They vote December 14th. People from across the political spectrum are outraged, so we’re planning to protest at Verizon retail stores across the country on December 7, one week before the vote and at the peak of the busy Holiday shopping season. We'll demand that our members of Congress take action to stop Verizon's puppet FCC from killing net neutrality.

**WHAT’S NET NEUTRALITY?**
Net neutrality is the [basic principle](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/05/the-case-for-rebooting-the-network-neutrality-debate/361809/) that has made the Internet into what it is today. It prevents big Internet Service Providers (like Verizon) from charging extra fees, engaging in censorship, or controlling what we see and do on the web by throttling websites, apps, and online services.

**WHY VERIZON STORES?**
The new chairman of the FCC, Ajit Pai, is a former top lawyer for Verizon, and the company has been spending millions on [lobbying](https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/12/15959932/comcast-verizon-att-net-neutrality-day-of-action) and lawsuits to kill net neutrality so they can gauge us all for more money. By protesting at Verizon stores, we’re shining light on the corruption and demanding that our local do something about it. Only Congress has the power to stop Verizon's puppet FCC, so at the protests we'll be calling and tweeting at legislators, and in cities where it's possible we'll march from Verizon stores to lawmakers offices.

**WHAT ARE OUR DEMANDS?**
Ajit Pai is clearly still working for Verizon, not the public. But he still has to answer to Congress. So we’re calling on our lawmakers to do their job overseeing the FCC and speak out against Ajit Pai’s plan to gut Title II net neutrality protections and give Verizon and other giant ISPs everything on their holiday wishlist. 

**HOW CAN I JOIN?**
[Click here](https://events.battleforthenet.com/#eventType=protestrally) and you’ll find an interactive map where you can see if there is already a protest planned near you. If not, you can [sign up to host one](http://act.demandprogress.org/event/team-internet/create/), and we’ll send you materials to make it easy and help you recruit others in your area. These protests will be quick, fun, and 100% legal. If you can’t attend a protest on December 7th, you can still help defend net neutrality by [calling your lawmakers](http://battleforthenet.com/) and spreading the word on social media. You can also sign up to host a meeting with your members of Congress, or volunteer for our texting team to help turn people out for these protests.",2017-11-22 01:29:11,JPTIII,147874,False,"['***Wanna do something about Net Neutrality??*** \n\n//// here’s how... \n\nThe FCC’s Republican chairman, Ajit Pai—isn’t going to get away with repealing net neutrality.. \n\nGo to www.gofccyourself.com \n——> click Express\n\n———> then say: “ Chairman Ajit Pai, I specifically support strong net neutrality, backed by title II oversight of ISP’s. \n\nPRESERVE NET NEUTRALITY & TITLE II “', 'Why not boycott Verizon?

(I\'ve read that if multiple people say the same thing, they just read it once, and then key it in as something like \'Form letter, 1000 submissions\' whereas with unique faxes they are required to read them all.)

Even if it was the ""unspoken rules"", when were these ""unspoken rules"" broken, so that they suddenly needed to be codified into regulations in 2015?\n\nWhat you\'re saying doesn\'t even make sense. It\'s like saying Affirmative Action was the ""unspoken rule"" before 1961, and Kennedy just decided to make it a law for no reason. Labor laws were ""unspoken rules"" before being enacted! \n\nLaws and regulations are (and should be) made in response to things, not ""just because"". Affirmative action was implemented **in response** to racial discrimination. Labor laws were put into place **in response** to unfair employer practices. Net Neutrality was implemented for some reason **just because** it was an ""unspoken rule"" that was never broken? Please.\n\n>As bigger and bigger monopolies came to be ISPS (cable companies) they started to experiment monetizing the traffic\n\nNo they didn\'t.\n\n>Sure they can; look at neflix and Comcast. They basiclly proved it. \n\nNo they didn\'t.\n\n>Title 2 is there to stop providers from extorting companies and snuffing out small players. \n\nNo it\'s not. Title 2 is an anti-discrimination clause specifically designed to prevent racial discrimination by phone carriers (it was written in 1934).\n\nTitle II: **SEC. 202. [47 U.S.C. 202] DISCRIMINATION AND PREFERENCES. (a) It shall be unlawful for any common carrier to make any unjust or unreasonable discrimination in charges, practices, classifications, regulations, facilities, or services for or in connection with like communication service, directly or indirectly, by any means or device, or to make or give any undue or unreasonable preference or advantage to any particular person, class of persons, or locality, or to subject any particular person, class of persons, or locality to any undue or unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage.**\n\nTaken in context, Title II is 100% about racism and preventing phone companies from discriminating against black people. Simple. It\'s irrelevant in 2017 and there is no evidence it\'s needed. It should be easy to gather such evidence, there was no net neutrality before 2015. So show me this time when ISP\'s were unscrupulously charging fees for some services and not for others...the so called justification for Title II in 2017...i\'m waiting.\n\n>Service providers would love to do it like mobile with metered Internet and data caps on customers,\n\nThey already do that. Net Neutrality doesn\'t prevent ISP\'s from metering data or implementing data caps across all users. Comcast already has a 1TB data cap.\n\n>then extort money from Internet sites at the same time.\n\nProve it.\n\n>This is about monopolies extending their physical access into a tax on our culture and speech. They must be regulated because they will try to tax every packet then turn that power into propaganda to keep the sheep in line.\n\nProve it.\n\n\nBy definition (for the sheep) -\n\nNet Neutrality = regulations\n\nRemoving regulations = opening internet\n\nPlacing regulations = restricting internet\n\nPretty simple.

For the early part of the Civil War the idea of abolition wasn’t at the forefront of the Union or even the soldiers necessary that’s correct.

The war evolved from a war to preserve the Union to preserving the Union and fighting against a slaving nation. \n\nAs for Confederate soldiers, the idea of seceding is on the forefront since they are the ones seceding. Especially over a states right to exercise slavery. Unlike the North who is reacting to a broken Union, the South’s cause is predicated far more on slavery than the North ever was at the start. In fact I’d argue that slavery and a states right to practice slavery was far more on their mind considering events sucks as Kansas and the fact that issues such as tax rates and total tarrif collections per harbor would have flown over most peoples heads at the time save for economists. It’s easier to understand states right to continue slavery than tarrifs or nullification crisis.', ""My takeaway is your comment has two parts, one about the causes of the war which we don't disagree on, and the second being that the soldiers were fairly engaged and motivated by the goals of their cause and leadership.

Things also get a little messy when your brothers and cousins are off fighting, a draft is right around the corner, and you're afraid of the inevitable destruction that war will bring with it.\n\nEssentially if every confederate soldier is held to the standard that they were actively promoting the causes of their leadership, why don't we hold solders to that standard today?  Should those who fought in Vietnam, Iraq/Afghanistan, etc be thought of as promoting American imperialism?  Those wars to me seemed unjust, should I look at the combatants as no better than mass murderers?  When it comes to the civil war, I see this level of moralizing placed on the soldiers that doesn't apply to any modern day soldiers."", 'For your first point, I was trying to argue that the average Confederate soldier wasn\'t blind as to what they were fighting for and its relevance to slavery. I\'m trying to avoid a clean Wehrmacht situation but with the Confederacy, which there has been historically from both an institutional and public perception.\n\nFor the second point, yes to a degree American soldiers engaged in wars across the world are partaking in creating American hegemony militarily and politically across the wider planet. The question then becomes, what\'s the alternative (see Ukrainian Russia War) and do we want it. The US and Europe for the most part coming of the boots of World War 2 essentially agreed either directly or indirectly that the US was going to be one of the main superpowers heavily influencing the world and spreading its culture (see the 60s and American cultural impact from the Marshall Plan years and its impact). Had the Civil War been simply states\' rights and the South had not had slavery in the first place at all, people would look differently at the war. The reason people don\'t scrutinize American soldiers as much is because for the longest time people didn\'t like the alternative and still don\'t. Vietnam can be argued, but you\'re going to have a hard time convincing people that Iraq and Afghanistan had factions that posed a better alternative. The US and even coalition forces weren\'t dragging their feet on the opening moments of the war. Note I am not talking about post war reconstruction/nation building failures. Those fall under a totally different subtopic. But by in large the world stage generally seemed to favor America as the alternative than say Saddam. Especially during the first Gulf War with the coalition.\n\nBut here\'s the thing, this all around about way of saying that people generally excuse the side that they think is right. People did the same for both World Wars. Yes, the Germans and Nazis were undeniably in the wrong and their ideologies atrocious. But the reason people look less harshly on Allied war crimes of mass aerial bombings is because the alternative to the Allies were the Axis.\n\nThe key point here is that the CSA\'s goals were more outwardly heinous and readily seeable compared to American involvement during the Cold War in kinetic conflicts or even the Middle East in the 21st Century.  I fully expect that in the coming decades people will cast major judgement on the soldiers and participants of the war. I mean American political view of the wars had already changed greatly. But no one is going to compare America to Nazi Germany when the alternatives prove to be generally worse or comically evil at times (not every conflict obv), and then hold US troops to the same standard.\n\nSo as to the point as to why we don\'t hold all sides equally responsible, its whataboutism that ignores that one side is clearly acting in a far worse manner. Put it this way, if the American Civil War happened right now, with the issue of slavery. Would anyone reasonably try to argue both sides when the alternative to the CSA is clearly better. The effect of globalization of the modern age greatly changes the dynamics of war and power.\n\nLastly all of this is over a flag. I\'m not trying to argue that every single southerner is evil or a slaver. The problem is that when people start waving a battle flag used during a time of Civil War over the issue of slavery claiming ""heritage"". At that point we are no longer talking about individuals. It\'s almost as laughable as waving a Swastika around and saying, ""but Schindler"". Why immediately point to such a divisive and low point in history as the defining proud heritage moment. And it\'s not just because the flag is cool, they have statues and bases named after Confederates, people talk about the South rising up ""again"". Why even have the entire concept of the Lost Cause, and then have people to this date bring up talking points. There\'s an idealization of a very specific timeframe and era.\n\nDouble lastly, in terms of conscripts. We don\'t look at Iraqi conscripts who mass surrendered during the Iraq wars in the same way we look at the Republican Guard/Tawakalna. The people who stayed back to fight were fanatics. In the Civil War and even conscripted soldiers in WW2, the soldiers who fought still ultimately fought for their institution. Just because they were conscripted doesn\'t change the fact that they still fought. If you don\'t outright surrender when given the chance, instead slog your way through literal hell on earth, at some point you\'ve lost your ""innocent because of conscription"" card.', '[deleted]', 'Then why use a term directly related to Bloody Kansas. This is like saying you aren’t talking about Nazis when you are arguing about the SS. \n\nAnd regardless. What’s the argument here? Do you expect me to say that someone shouldn’t fight against someone trying to murder them on an individual level? There’s a stark difference between that and claiming that the entirety of southern heritage is linked to only fighting war criminals. \n\nThe cultural zeitgeist/meaning of a battle flag is to promote the cause for which a side is fighting for. If someone was walking around in SS regalia and they told you that their ancestor was in a front line only unit, does that suddenly change the overall meaning of the Swastika, Iron Cross, and SS bolts? Does that change the fact that the SS was highly complicit and one of the main driving forces behind the Holocaust?\n\nIn the same vein parading around a battle flag for a side that seceded to preserve the institution of slavery doesn’t suddenly change the overall meaning when you look at one single instance.', '*Chris Stapleton has entered the chat*\n\nThat man is more country music than even 20 years ago.

So I can see that going even further with people in their 40s and 50s. \n\nMaybe that reticence goes away in their 60s tho. I think once people get to the stage where they are taking care of kids, they are focused on that. Once the kids grow up, perhaps these people have too much free time and feel kicked out of society. That's why Trump and Friends can grab them all, because he makes them feel less lonely and a part of something big. \n\nThe other big thing is religion.

The reason they are all revered and have statues isn\'t just slavery-related. They were generally good people who were well educated for the time and involved in their communities that just ended up on the wrong side regionally. There was a lot of pressure for them to fight for the South against what really were their friends and classmates. To condemn them all also seems to condemn the military academy, their involvement in the Mexican American War, and whatever good they did in their community after the war.\n\nFor example, Lewis Armistead charged during Pickett\'s charge at Gettyburg his best friends Winfield Hancock\'s Brigade and died following the attack. They had been together for all of the Mexican American War and found out about the Civil War while stationed in San Diego together. They went out and partied and pledged to not kill each other on the battle field and it happened anyway. Armistead\'s father and 4 brothers fought in the war of 1812 and his maternal grandfather was a US Congressman that killed a founding father in a duel that led to duel\'s being outlawed. These aren\'t just dudes that fought for the confederacy they were closely intertwined with the US government on many levels for generations.\n\nJames Longstreet who was Lee\'s right hand man continued in politics in the US as the Marshall of Georgia and later the Commissioner of Railroads under McKinnely and Teddy.\n\nI guess my point of this rambling is more so that the Civil War is a much more complex social and behavioral event than can simply be described with, ""slavery is bad."" Do I think that those who fly the confederate flag understand this? Not quite... I think they\'re largely uneducated southerners looking for an excuse to be a problem, but I\'m also a white dude from California with liberal parents and am not going to opine on the feelings of Southerners.\n\nIf it makes just one black person feel uncomfortable though that is enough for me to think it should be banned, but let\'s also not try to pretend that the Civil War wasn\'t fought by real people who did some good and some bad things or just to hide from our history.

Many of the top guys in the war for the Confederate Army were Westpoint graduates that had also fought in the Mexican-American War for the United States. The reason they are all revered and have statues isn\'t just slavery-related. They were generally good people who were well educated for the time and involved in their communities that just ended up on the wrong side regionally. There was a lot of pressure for them to fight for the South against what really were their friends and classmates.\n\nFor example, Lewis Armistead charged during Pickett\'s charge at Gettyburg his best friends Winfield Hancock\'s Brigade and died following the attack. They had been together for all of the Mexican American War and found out about the Civil War while stationed in San Diego together. They went out and partied and pledged to not kill eachother on the battle field and it happened anyway.\n\nI guess my point of this rambling is more so that the Civil War is a much more complex social and behavioral event than can simply be described with, ""slavery is bad."" Do I think that those who rock the confederate flag understand this? Not quite... I think they\'re largely uneducated southerners looking for an excuse to be a problem, but I\'m also a white dude from California with liberal parents and am not going to opine on the feelings of Southerners.

22,top,Music,"The FCC is expected to announce a vote to gut net neutrality rules the day before Thanksgiving. Only a big burst of phone calls to Congress can stop them from allowing ISPs to charge us extra fees to access sites, apps, games, and especially the music we all love.","Hey everyone, **the chairman of the FCC, is very likely to announce a vote to gut neutrality, possibly as soon as Nov. 22nd.** Once a vote is called, it will become much, much harder to stop ISPs from charging us all extra fees to access streaming services or watch music videos -- and they can demand payment from independent artists and labels, stifling independent voices

**[But there’s still hope. The most effective way to can stop this is by driving as many calls as possible to our Senators and Representatives, now through Nov. 22nd. ](https://www.battleforthenet.com)**

We're getting word that there are lawmakers who are sympathetic to our cause and considering taking action to slow the FCC down, but they won’t act unless they get more phone calls from constituents. Also, if your think your Rep's opposed to net neutrality, its all the more reason to call them. Those Reps need to hear your voice more than anyone.

**Please, head over to https://www.battleforthenet.com , and give your Senators and Reps a call telling them to stop the FCC from slashing Title II net neutrality protections.** The time to act is now.

To reach the call in line directly by phone, **call 202-930-8550**.

When you get through to your Rep's office, introduce yourself, be polite, and say: 
> I support ""Title Two"" net neutrality rules and I urge you to oppose the FCC's plan to repeal them. Specifically, I'd like you to contact the FCC Chairman and demand he abandon his current plan.

My comment about is directed at the decision makers at the top of the organization of the FCC.  Without a doubt, many people with the FCC are as adamant about protecting net neutrality as we are.  Be careful with those pitchforks!*\n\nThis isn\'t tinfoil hattery. It\'s called Regulatory Capture, and it is a very real issue.

I appreciate having the benefit of your comments on this matter. \n  \nOver the past two decades, Americans have increasingly relied on the Internet in their personal and professional lives, and new technologies play a central role in the Internet’s growing importance. Many of these technologies have been developed in Texas. As Texans and Americans, we all benefit from advancements that encourage economic growth and make day-to-day life easier. \n  \nWe need policies to meet the evolving challenges of technological advancement. However, government regulations move slower than technology, and we must ensure the laws we pass do not stifle innovation. A top-down regulatory approach can unnecessarily constrain an industry’s ability to create and deliver new products and services to market. In the Senate, I have supported laws that facilitate innovation and opposed those which threaten it. For example, I supported the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (P.L. 112-29), which modernized our outdated patent system by improving the application process and reducing litigation. \n \nAs you may know, on May 18, 2017, the FCC voted 2-1 to pass the “Restoring Internet Freedom” Notice of Proposed Rule Making (NPRM). The NPRM intends to replace the regulatory structure of the 2015 Open Internet Order, commonly referred to as Net Neutrality, with a light-touch regulatory framework that protects consumers, closes the digital divide and brings next-generation networks and services to all Americans. The successful vote opened a two month comment period on how to best maintain a free and open Internet. If you wish to file your comments on the NPRM with the FCC, you may do so here: https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs . The deadline for submitting comments is July 17, 2017. \n \nI support the FCC’s transparent approach to reduce burdensome regulation and improve internet access and services. I am also proud to cosponsor the Restoring Internet Freedom Act (S. 993). This legislation would nullify the net neutrality rule, ensure Congress maintains its primary authority to reshape communications policy, and restore the competitive freedom that has characterized the Internet. S.993 has been referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. Although I am not a member of this Committee, I will be sure to keep your views in mind should S. 993 be considered by the full Senate during the 115th Congress.\n \nI appreciate the opportunity to represent Texas in the United States Senate. Thank you for taking the time to contact me. \n \nSincerely, \n \nJOHN CORNYN \nUnited States Senator \n"", ""Everyone single person in the USA could sign the petitions and the FCC would still fuck us over.

Now you're called Republicans thanks to southern strategy.”\n\nAh yes, the famous and unproven “party switch argument”. If that were the case, care to tell me why it’s mostly Democrat run cities that are having such horrible riots and instances of racism?\n\n“If you care about being labelled racist, please research these things and educate yourself. I don't expect you to believe me. I expect you to go find out. That you wont do the work is something I expect. Please exceed my expectations.”\n\nPlease, the word “racist” has been used so much that it’s basically meaningless now. I disagree on the simplest thing and all of a sudden I’m a racist.

In fact, to minimize the Southern Strategy to just racism is stupid at best considering the numerous factors involved at the time.

Specifically, the notion that music is inherently political (which is the comment I directly replied to). \n\nThe reason the article is hilarious is because rage’s music is intentionally political. It’s the whole point of its existence; the lyrics are designed to convey a political stance to the listener. And if you miss that message, how can you say you like the music? It’s the core component. \n\nBut if you take the lyrics out of a rage song, is it still political? If so, which part conveys the political message? The drums? The guitar?\n\nMy point is this: for a piece of music to be political, it must convey a political stance to the listener. Me banging on my drumset in 4/4 is not “inherently political,” despite being technically music.', ""Do you think its a coincidence that in the early 20th century jazz music was widely decried for being a leftist subversion even though it didn't have lyrics? \n\nThere's a lot in a political ideology that can be said without words. If your world view is based around order, and someone comes along and removes order from something like music, well that's going to play a large role in why you dislike it; its an affront to your worldview. \n\nEven just the fact that a musical landscape shifts in such a big way is a political change, its a shift in the status quo that will affect people's mindset and could affect their worldview, even with no lyrics. If I'm listening to instrumental death metal all day the chances are I'll be more amped up, vs low-fi hip hop which will melow me out. Just that slight emotional change will change my outlook during the day and over time that kind of stuff has its own affects, even on politics\n\nMusic also has predictive physical impacts on its listeners, meaning that playing certain things will make people want to move in certain ways, i.e. you can't dance The Charleston to a violin quartet playing a waltz. And how people dance has big effects on politics, so just with certain notes, you can make a political statement within the historical context of when its made.\n\nAnd speaking of history, when you look at musical theory you can see a lot of political arguments crop up through just understandings of how notes are put together. People see music as an extension of themselves, and an extension of their culture. So when some music they don't like becomes popular part of their revulsion is that it doesn't represent them. This is what happened with rap and hip hop in America; all of a sudden the most dominant music was something that felt distant to many people, so much so that they even say its not music. You could say a lot of the lyrics in rap are the reason for that, but I disagree because the format of rap is so jarring to many people that even with lyrics that represent them they still don't like it and call it fake music. It doesn't represent their understanding of their culture, and that feeling creates/furthers political struggles. This is why so many political agents understand that if you don't win the culture war eventually you'll lose the political war, so you have people like Ben Shapiro reviewing Beyonce's albums as a segment on his broadcast.\n\nTL;DR Instrumental music, lyrical music, they all play a large part on the political landscape for many reasons both emotional and physical; even if just for the fact that any kind of cultural shift is a change to the status quo, which is a political shift."", 'So we’ll put.

We were listening to a pre-release actually. There was a photoshoot going on at the shop. Lots of people around. I was working behind the counter, watching the action from my post when I heard a quiet, ""hey, man."" It was Chester. He was smaller than I envisioned. He spoke quietly and politely as he asked about some jewelry in the case. \n\nAnd that was kind of the extent of it. I would see him every few months for the 5+ years I was with the company. We would small-talk about stuff and go on about our business. \n\nHe was this giant of a man when it came to his talent, but a lesson in humility every time I saw him. I don\'t even know what to say at this point. Some people have all the best and worst things in life. Despite his fame, fortune, and talent- he was still a tortured soul. Abusive spouse (previous marriage, no clue about the current one), sexual abuse, bullying, and obviously crippling depression. \n\nBut regardless of that all that. His music has affected millions in a big, wonderful way. His legacy will remain as such. My memory of him will remain that he was a good dude who inspired me to remain humble and gracious. \n\nThis fucking sucks.\n\nRIP Chester. \n\nEdit: Thank you kind strangers for the Gold. \n\nEdit 2: Today has been a crazy roller coaster.

Through thick and thin, he was always there. The connection I felt.. That bond.. Sigh.. \n\nI'd like to point out some notable songs for people who stopped listening to Linkin Park after Meteora (2nd album). Note that, most of my favorite songs are actually after their first 2 albums. It's mostly because I connected way more with their later songs, in a much deeper level. That's not to say their first 2 albums aren't top-notch.. They are, just not compared to the later albums on a connection level.\n\n- [Leave Out All The Rest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZIummTz9mM)\nWhenever I heard this song.. I thought about Vegeta (from Dragon Ball Z). It's not because of an AMV that I saw or anything. I originally really just about Vegeta.

I hope no one minds my reposting of it, if it\'s inappropriate please let me know and I will delete it.\n\nThis is...really sad.  This post is kind of a mess because I was trying to find information about this show while I wrote it and I kept going back and adding information.  Sorry about that.\n\nSo, I met these guys right before the release of Hybrid Theory.  They were an opening act...\n\n...I can\'t think of who the headliner was though...Found it!  Looks like I was there to see Twiztid and Kottonmouth Kings - no wonder I couldn\'t really remember that part of the show.  I was going though a juggalo phase, think of that what you will.  Oh yeah, ReHab was there and at that time they were this corny rap group who actually had strippers that toured with them.  Same songs, but they sounded completely different.\n\nRight - they were opening that tour (I don\'t think anyone was there to see them, in fact) at a little club in Winston Salem, NC:  Ziggy\'s.  It\'s closed now but they used to have some amazing shows.  I saw acts from Hank Williams III to Deftones to Weezer to ICP there, it was a really kind of ""close"" space - just about anywhere you were, it felt like you could reach out and touch the people on stage.\n\n...or at least get fully doused in Faygo\n\nAnyway, their show - this would have been around mid-to-late 1999 (found it!  Looking through setlist.fm - it was September 18th, 2000) was just amazing, partly because of the venue but largely because of their performance.\n\nThere couldn\'t have been more than a couple of dozen people in the place for their show, but it was probably one of the tightest live performances I\'ve *ever* seen - and I\'ve helped run sound for acts like MDC, Jucifer, Skeleton Witch, and plenty of others - not to mention the shows I\'ve attended as an audience member.\n\nThe guitar player wore headphones.  I\'ve never seen anyone else do that.  The ""DJ"" didn\'t just do the record-scratching that it seemed all other rap-rock-metal-alternative-Bizkit-bands did around then.  He was live-sampling and mixing the levels of the other members on stage.  The synergy between them was on another level.  The live sound was pretty much album-quality, but it was right *there*...\n\nI told them as much after the show.  They were humble, gracious, and extremely nice.  I told them straight up:  You guys are going to be selling out arenas before too much longer.  I\'m paraphrasing here, but Chester said something like ""that would be amazing, but I don\'t really think so.  We\'ve been doing this kind of thing for a while now and we just love going around and playing for people who are into the music.""  It seemed like they weren\'t thinking ""what does the radio want, how can we sell a hundred million records?"" - they were more like ""this is what we sound like when we do what we love, enjoy it with us.\n\nChester and Mike signed two demo tapes for me.  I\'ve still got them.  Besides tshirts, posters, and other random merch that I\'ve been given by bands who I\'ve booked or done stage work for, I don\'t really have any other ""memorabilia"" - just those two tapes.  I stopped paying attention to them well over a decade ago.  I just wasn\'t into the sound anymore, to be honest - tastes change.  I still think the first record is brilliant, and the second record is pretty great too - those songs will always remind me of my early years in the Marines.  Someone was almost always blasting one of those CDs during field day.\n\nI mopped so many floors to those tracks.\n\nI wish he hadn\'t gone so soon.  He was full of music, and poetry.  Maybe it was a bit on-the-nose, a bit too much angst...too much anger, resentment, and other vague but passionate feelings towards an undefined ""you.""  Some might say that\'s simplistic, formulaic - but it allows for the listener to place themselves in the narrative of the song, and recognize the things that they\'re feeling - and know by extension that they\'re not alone.  As an angsty young guy with too many hormones and too little life experience, it was very therapeutic sometimes to just turn the volume up and scream along.

I still have the Sanity receipt for it stapled into one of my diaries that I used to write in every day. \n\nLive in Texas was going to be released the same year and I was ITCHING to have it, I begged and begged my mum, she bought it for me and said I could have it at Christmas- I\'m nearly certain that that was THE longest month of summer I\'ve ever had to endure; luckily for me though, there was someone on my street who was ""allowed"" to listen to it immediately. I remember, because I could hear it from inside their house, floating up to my bedroom balcony. I would sit outside on that bloody balcony, straining my ears, trying to listen to it with whoever that amazing person was.\nThat\'s the only real waiting-for-something excitement I can remember from my childhood, I must have watched that DVD a million times. \nI had *the* biggest crush on Chester. \n\nBecause Linkin Park was my first proper band that I listened to, I needed to get all their music and put it somehwere.\nI\'ll never forget, I had this dark blue, denim CD case that I would haul around with me everywhere, it unfortunately got stolen while I was at school but it was FAT by the end of my time with it. I ended up with so many CD\'s; Linkin Park, Marilyn Manson and Disturbed were my favourites but Linkin Park arrived first so they were like my favourite pair of pyjamas. I knew every word, every beat, every note, they kept me comfy always.\nMe, my discman and my CD\'S went everywhere. Endless train travels, plane trips,  car rides.\n\nLP and Chester\'s words were there through my years and years of self harm, some of the lonliest hours of my life, my parents divorce, the court cases and all the other shit I don\'t want to think about. \nI don\'t really know how to put into words how much this band helped form me, I was so young and I had all this horrible shit going through my head, I had no one to talk to and it was so soothing to know that there was someone else out there, whom I\'d never met, who came from a completely different place in the world to me on all fronts, that felt the same way I did.\nWhat I took from Chester and the rest of the band at the time was that it\'s alright to have, and feel emotions.\nTapping into my feelings started me writing and drawing darker and stranger things to get them out of my head rather than trying to keep them in and pretend they weren\'t there. Unfortunately, I\'d already started the self harm, but it stopped it from escalating until much later down the line. So, I\'m thankful for that too.\n\nIts funny, after I moved away from home, I went on a kind of music hiatus. I listened to a bit, tried to find some new stuff that worked for me- I kinda did? but definitely didn\'t at the same time. You know, even in the car, just silence- I\'m still doing that.\n\nAbout 3 months ago, *this* song was on the radio at work, I didn\'t mind it- also didn\'t know who it was. I used to hum the chorus because I didn\'t know the words, not really paying attention.\nIt was soon pointed out to me by my now-boyfriend that it was actually Linkin Park- it pains me now to say but I was horrified, I hadn\'t actively listened to them since Minutes after Midnight and didn\'t realise they\'d just kept changing their sound (it should have been evident, really, my man made a really good point) so I figured\n""They were mine once, they can be again, I just gotta give it a chance.""\n\nIn the foreground, these last few months my world flipped upside down and I felt myself sliding down an all-too-familiar slope.\nSuicidal thoughts crept back in after an extended absence, and I was listening to ""Heavy"" on repeat.\n\nThere\'s a moment in time that gets me about a month and a half ago I reckon. For me it was surreal:\nThere I was, sitting on a mattress, earphones in, rocking side to side, tears rolling down my face, filling up my head with Chester\'s voice, trying my best to block out the fucked thoughts that were running through my head faster than I could catch them. I was 12 again at 26. \nThe words in this song were exactly the same as mine in my head- just like they used to be; Just slower, more defined and less frightful to listen to.\nChester\'s still got it! Even after all this time, we still think the same.\n""I don\'t like my mind right now, stacking up problems that are so unnecessary, wish that I could slow things down, I want to let go but there\'s comfort in the panic.

That is not always the case. The human mind and psychology are extremely complex and unique to each individual. You can't treat everyone like you treat a cold or a body disease.\n\nThere are too many factors to take into account regarding the mind. Just because you have depression and somehow pulled through, it doesn't mean others can even with help.\n\nSure suicide is not pleasant, it's not the best solution if a solution at all not to mention the people you leave behind. But this is also selfish from the people that are left behind and all the people that say this is selfish from the person that commits suicide.\n\nTo get to the point in which you want to kill yourself and you see it as a solution, it means you are in a really bad mental state. Whether it's because of another issue like depression, anxiety etc. or because you just can't take it anymore from all the outside issues that you have to face is irrelevant. See that's the issue, most people don't take this into account because if you don't experience such states you can't relate to them, you don't need depression or another mental issue in order to get broken, those are just pouring gasoline on an issue that is already there.\n\nYou have reached the point in which you prefer to end it than to continue. That's a lot of suffering and pain in ones mind. Why is it ok for someone with a disease like cancer or worse to choose to die and not seek treatment or have medical euthanasia but when someone in a really bad mental state wants to die it's not ok because you have to think about the people around you.\n\nIt's the same thing, mental issues are worse than physical issues, it's your own mind, the body can be damaged but you can still be happy and function normally. Whereas with depression and other mental issues that is a hard thing to achieve for most, to be happy and function properly.\n\nHe was not selfish, the man battled drug and alcohol addictions for years, he was abused when he was little, that takes a huge toll on ones mind. There are limits to what you and your mind can take and when that limit is reached, no amount of medication or help can take you out of that state, you become broken and you are aware of it (that's the worse part).\n\nWhy would you stay alive when you know there's going to be just mental struggles on and on and on. That's like shooting someone in the abdomen and slowly letting them die. Sure they will still live for what, a few hours ? But they will be in extreme pain and eventually die. That's what happens with the mind when it's pushed to the limits, you just prolong your suffering because society tells you it's not ok to choose otherwise.\n\nAgain, I'm not pro suicide and it's really sad that we live in a world in which you can get to the point in which you think that is a solution. It saddens me. But you can't expect to know what's going on through another persons mind and how much suffering there is in there, you just can't. So there is no way in which you can accurately say that he was selfish or that he shouldn't have done that, only he knows what challenges and struggles he had to face since he was a child to reach such a critical point and just say fuck it and commit suicide.\n\nI hope he found the peace he desired, the rest is history at this point.

Again, DEPRESSION IS VERY TREATABLE. PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY IS IMPORTANT. He is an adult, and a man. He needs to get treatment himself. This isn\'t anyone else\'s job. Don\'t bring children into this world if you\'re unstable like this then... THEY AREN\'T THERE TO SERVE YOU. My statements are not a ""if I can do it, so can he, and so can everyone"" statement. The fact is very clear that depression is remarkably treatable, and so long as that is true, you can\'t compare this to a terminal illness, because it isn\'t one.', 'I didn\'t say it\'s not treatable, I said that being treated with meds and / or by professionals does not work for everyone. You can\'t put the mind in the same category as physical issues since it\'s very unique to the individual and what they experience in life and how they perceive life and the experiences they go through.\n\nJust because the media says that he has depression and whatnot, that doesn\'t mean he didn\'t have deeper issues going on, issues that he probably preferred to keep to himself, issues that can\'t be explained to the general public, because why would he, he isn\'t a book for people to read as they wish, he can keep whatever he wants to himself as we all do.\n\nYou don\'t need to have depression or a certain mental issue in order to get in a very serious and dangerous mental state. I\'ve been there, I don\'t have depression or other mental issues, not medical ones at least.\n\nI\'ve lived with such people, I\'ve worked with such people and I\'ve been in such a position myself. They are broken people, broken by other humans, broken by their experiences in life, broken by addictions, by traumas and so on. \n\nThe basics of everything are simple yet so complex. We are still dominated by instincts and animal impulses. Just because we live in society, have technology and food in the market that doesn\'t change anything. Our bodies and minds still work like it works with any other animal.\n\nIf you stress and abuse someone and depending on how they view things and how badly they get affected by said events and actions and people, you crash mentally, the body and mind can give up on you. There are studies that show this, how messed up our mind is that it can choose to make you want to kill yourself to end your suffering because it\'s not optimal in nature to have a damaged individual that can\'t fend for itself or can\'t take care of itself, so the body slowly makes you want to end it. No amount of meds and help can take you out of those traumas and all that abuse and suffering you\'ve been through for so many years.\n\nI didn\'t say anything about children or his family regarding why he has them. In order for someone to establish a normal and healthy relationship and go even further into having children, you should first be ok with yourself and be able to love yourself. Otherwise you will bring all your issues into the relationship / family and that\'s not pretty for anyone. But that\'s not something I care to talk about because that\'s not what this is about.\n\nYou are very narrow minded to get offended by the simple truths of life and how bad things can get for some of us. You think that just because there is an establishment that tells you it can treat you, it will just happen because it exists and tells you that it can treat you ? Yeah it does for most people that have depression, anxiety and other clinical issues. \n\nBut go deeper into how messed up things can get inside your head and how fucked up you can get, how deep you can fall into your own world that nothing can help you. There is such a thing as a point of no return, it\'s not fairy tales and sci-fi stuff. It\'s a sad reality we live in with messed up humans, messed up diseases and messed up society.\n\nYou just look at things from your own little narrow perspective. You believe that just because you have depression and the help you received worked, it will work for anyone. Reality check, mate, that\'s not how reality works unfortunately for everyone.\n\nYou think that depression is the end of the mental road, it\'s not, it\'s the beginning or not even for much worse things.\n\nI\'m happy for you and that you got your mind together and no longer have or have less negative thoughts. But understand that things can get much much worse and to put it into words and simple terms and your perspective which has nothing to do with the perspective of those that are in those situations.\n\nWant to hear a really nice story ? My mother never had any issues until she was mentally abused by her family, they treated her like shit, they made her paranoid about things, they pushed her mind to the limits and broke her. 20 fucking years later she is worse by the day and she received meds and help in those 20 years, nothing works, why ? Everything she went through took a heavy toll on her. She tried to kill herself twice but somehow managed to fail each time, she has severe depression and anxiety as a result of those traumas and not the other way around.  Don\'t tell me that anything can be repaired or fixed, because they can\'t in some cases, they just can\'t, that includes the human mind, that\'s childish thinking.\n\nSo excuse me that I\'m not a student of psychology, I just had the ""pleasure"" of living in this reality, of having to take care of severely damaged people and see how the human mind can truly work, both in good ways and devastating ways.', 'GET THE FUCK OUT.

PIGEON FORGE, Tenn. (WZTV) — Dollywood on Tuesday announced they'll start paying a hundred percent of tuition for employees who wish to further their education. This includes the cost of fees and textbooks.

The education benefit package is available to all team members on the first day of their employment. The company says it's a way for employees at all levels to pursue their personal and professional dreams.

Piloted by Dolly Parton's operating partner Herschend Enterprises, the program from GROW U. will mark a significant investment for workers. President of Dollywood Company Eugene Naughton says it's an opportunity for employees to grow.

""One of The Dollywood Foundation’s key tenets is to ‘learn more.’ This program is created with that very tenet in mind. We want our hosts to develop themselves through advanced learning to fulfill the foundation’s other tenets: care more, dream more, and be more.""
The program will officially launch Feb. 24 for all seasonal, part-time, and full-time employees at Dollywood Parks & Resorts. Hosts can enroll in the program on their first day of employment.

""When our hosts strive to grow themselves, it makes our business and our community a truly better place,"" Naughton said.

He used to love doing it because he had some freedom in how he taught his classes. He could actually engage students, some of which had returned in later years to thank him for the job he did. He and my mom lived paycheck to paycheck because he wanted to make a lasting change. Now, while he still tries to keep things engaging, he's counting down the days to retirement. These days you have to teach kids a more strict curriculum so they perform well on the standardized tests, because that's how our government decides how much funding to give our schools. It's a broken system.\n\nHell even the text books teachers have to stick with don't have to be all that accurate. When you've got very few companies running the industry you don't have to be too worried about quality. \n\nAlso keep in mind that we have a governor who ran on a promise that we would take away teachers' pensions, essentially saying that taxpayers are the ones paying into it. \n\nDespite all this, there are still people working to become teachers in this corrupt state, knowing all the hurdles they're going to have to jump.

One entity collects that data, and everyone bases how they do their business around those numbers. Some stations disregard them, but they’re always there, no matter how much you ignore them because competitors will manipulate those numbers against you. It’s a damned if you do and damned if you don’t situation. \n\nSecondly, look at the royalties that need to be paid to ASCAP, BMI, and whoever else claims to be collecting fees on behalf of the artists that are being played, when in actuality is less than 1/4 or smaller of the money charged that actually goes to the artist. \n\nThere’s a lot more to the equation of the cost of running a music radio station, but those are two elements that start compounding costs pretty quickly. Combine that with station managers paying themselves more than they should while their on air staff make just enough to get by, if they’re lucky to make that much, it’s a cash out to flip the format and not deal with music formats at all. \n\nAlso consider that the Bible is essentially free domain and not susceptible to royalties like music is. You could turn the mic on and just read the Bible all day long if you wanted to. \n\nThere are a lot of other aspects to these changes, but seriously... Long live rock and roll. ', 'You seem knowledgeable.  I’m curious, how do radio stations even make money?', 'The short of it is advertising. \n\nThere are different ways a station can format themselves, but it always boils down to advertising in some form. Even listener driven stations that stay on the air by “donations” are consistently advertising themselves as such for people to give them money to keep the station on the air. \n\nBut the basic, commercial radio station is selling you, the listener, to entities who want to promote a product or service. The radio station tends to have a demographic that they aim to be the best at capturing, i.e. men 18-35 or females 25-40. If you can be number one in that demographic and beat the snot out of your competition, you rule the local market and can jack up the rates it costs for someone to advertise on your airwaves because ads running on the #1 station in the market hits more of said target demographic than it does on other stations ranked lower, in theory. \n\nThat’s the basic explanation with lots of holes that others are free to fill in. Regardless, selling airtime to advertisers is not as important to making money as much as selling the amount of listeners you have to prospective businesses that are willing to pay for airtime to promote said business, service, or event. \n\nContests and giveaways fall into that as well, but that’s just a gimmick to keep that demographic that they are selling to stick around and keep those ratings numbers up.
