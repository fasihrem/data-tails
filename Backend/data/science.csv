But I wonder if there’s still a possibility that they’re quantifying some sort of trauma/abuse that isn’t necessarily “gaslighting”.  \nThis particular form of abuse has become a hot topic and I think is often applied too broadly by the general public.

The Gaslighting Relationship Exposure Inventory (GREI) consists of 11 items and was found to be a reliable and valid measure for both men and women across two different cultural samples—Israel and the United States. The study also highlights that exposure to gaslighting is closely related to psychological abuse and can contribute to mental health issues, such as depression, while also negatively affecting relationship quality.\n\nGaslighting is a form of manipulation in which one person makes another doubt their own perceptions, memories, or reality. In the context of romantic relationships, gaslighting can involve a partner repeatedly invalidating their partner’s experiences. They might deny that certain events took place, accuse their partner of overreacting, or suggest their partner is confused or mistaken. Over time, this manipulative behavior can erode the gaslightee’s confidence and self-trust, leading to feelings of disorientation and emotional distress.\n\nGaslighting is particularly harmful because it can make victims question their sense of reality. The subtle nature of gaslighting often leaves victims unaware of the manipulation for long periods. The authors behind the new research sought to provide a scientifically validated tool that can reliably measure the extent of gaslighting exposure in intimate relationships. Until now, there has been a shortage of such tools, hindering both research on the subject and efforts to support those affected by it.\n\nThe researchers found that participants who experienced more gaslighting reported higher levels of depression and lower relationship quality, even after accounting for other forms of intimate partner violence. This suggests that gaslighting has distinct and harmful effects on an individual’s emotional well-being, above and beyond other abusive behaviors.', ""Gaslighting is like an invisible poison, it slowly erodes our sense of reality and self-worth without us even realizing it. it's literally a psychological abuse that leaves scars deeper than anyone can see.""]",12,https://www.psypost.org/are-you-a-victim-of-gaslighting-new-tool-helps-identify-manipulative-behaviors-in-relationships/,https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/1fdggyx/exposure_to_gaslighting_is_closely_related_to/

The rise of internet pornography has given users easy access to violent and degrading content, which some fear may influence harmful behaviors. Previous studies have produced inconsistent results regarding the connection between pornography exposure and sexual aggression, with some research finding strong correlations and others finding only weak or no associations.\n\nThe inconsistency may be due to the fact that most research has examined pornography use as a single, general category, rather than distinguishing between types of content. For example, some studies have found that violent pornography is more strongly linked to sexual aggression than nonviolent pornography.

The study is the latest in a mounting body of research on COVID-19 from UT Austin researchers, who have contributed to several milestone advancements in the fight against the virus, including the development of mRNA COVID vaccines.\n>\n>For this study, researchers collected the blood of infected Austinites and analyzed the antibodies they produced, one researcher told KUT. SC27 was isolated from a single patient, but researchers were able to identify the molecular sequence of the antibody. That paves the way for it to be replicated for use in COVID-19 treatments.\n>\n>“One goal of this research … is to work toward a universal vaccine that can generate antibodies and create an immune response with broad protection to a rapidly mutating virus,” said Will Voss, one of the project’s leaders and a recent UT Austin PhD graduate, in a statement from the university.\n>\n>Like other protective antibodies, SC27 works by binding to a part of the COVID-19 virus called the spike protein. The spike protein allows the virus to attach to cells within the human body. It also has mutated between different COVID-19 variants, helping the virus to evade efforts by vaccines and other treatments to protect cells.\n>\n>Researchers say SC27, however, has the ability to recognize differences in the spike protein from variant to variant.\n\n---\n\nJournal link:\n\n[Hybrid immunity to SARS-CoV-2 arises from serological recall of IgG antibodies distinctly imprinted by infection or vaccination](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379124003823)\n\nSummary:\n\n>We describe the molecular-level composition of polyclonal immunoglobulin G (IgG) anti-spike antibodies from ancestral severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, vaccination, or their combination (“hybrid immunity”) at monoclonal resolution. Infection primarily triggers S2/N-terminal domain (NTD)-reactive antibodies, whereas vaccination mainly induces anti-receptor-binding domain (RBD) antibodies. This imprint persists after secondary exposures wherein >60% of ensuing hybrid immunity derives from the original IgG pool. Monoclonal constituents of the original IgG pool can increase breadth, affinity, and prevalence upon secondary exposures, as exemplified by the plasma antibody SC27. Following a breakthrough infection, vaccine-induced SC27 gained neutralization breadth and potency against SARS-CoV-2 variants and zoonotic viruses (half-maximal inhibitory concentration [IC50] ∼0.1–1.75 nM) and increased its binding affinity to the protective RBD class 1/4 epitope (dissociation constant [KD] < 5 pM). According to polyclonal escape analysis, SC27-like binding patterns are common in SARS-CoV-2 hybrid immunity. Our findings provide a detailed molecular definition of immunological imprinting and show that vaccination can produce class 1/4 (SC27-like) IgG antibodies circulating in the blood.\n\nfrom the Discussion:\n\n>Based upon our observations of IgG anti-S repertoires in vaccinated BT donors, our results suggest that deploying diverse RBDs in next-generation vaccine strategies (to emulate hybrid immunological S scenarios) should elicit SC27-like class 1/4 antibodies that have lengthy CDR-H3 loops juxtaposed with the RBD β sheet backbone to confer broad reactivity while the orientation of their light chains should contribute to steric blockade of the ACE2-binding site. Hence, vaccines capable of triggering these antibodies might offer protection against SARS-CoV-2, its variants, and newly emerging zoonotic sarbecoviruses, eliminating the necessity for frequent updates in response to new outbreaks.', '[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379124003823](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379124003823)\n\nPrevious findings on hybrid immunity show:\n\n>.. Furthermore, an increasingly significant portion of the human population has acquired hybrid immunity to SARS-CoV-2, stemming from the combined protection of natural immunity following repeated cycles of infection and vaccination. While the profound impacts of immunological imprinting resulting from prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and its various effects on hybrid immune enhancement and immune recall have been documented, the phenomenon remains unresolved at the molecular level of the IgG anti-S plasma proteome and its individual components. While it is widely acknowledged that hybrid priming through infection and vaccination generally enhances immunity, there is a need for additional clarity regarding the imprint left by the ancestral virus infection or vaccination at the pandemic’s onset. This includes understanding the impact of the chronological sequence of infection preceding vaccination on the serological IgG repertoire, or vice versa, and the subsequent patterns established by early VOCs.\n\n---\n\n>... The combined impact of infection and vaccination results in hybrid immunity that can exploit a broad and potent neutralization epitope conserved in SARS-related coronaviruses ...\n\nResults:\n\n>... SC27 potently neutralizes ancestral and contemporary SARS-CoV-2 VOC and many antigenically distinct zoonotic sarbecoviruses poised for human emergence.\n\n---\n\n>... Following a breakthrough infection, vaccine-induced SC27 gained neutralization breadth and potency against SARS-CoV-2 variants and zoonotic viruses ...\n\nA potentially huge advance in COVID vaccines.

After concerns [were raised](https://pubpeer.com/publications/CC52948B43670BCD51E1B617E7BDAC) by readers, the Editor-in-Chief [ordered a review](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopha.2024.116183) and ultimately requested the retraction of the article.

The decision to retract was based on two major issues: 1) Reliability of the data (in particular the Belgian dataset) and 2) the assumption that all patients were being treated the same pharmacologically. Because of these issues, the Editor-in-Chief found the conclusions of the article to be unreliable and ordered the retraction.

The study also found that these couples tend to report higher sexual distress and a decline in their relationship satisfaction over time.\n\nWhile sexual communication has been studied in various ways—such as the frequency and quality of discussions—specific communication patterns during sexual conflicts, like demand-withdrawal, have not received as much attention. Demand-withdrawal communication occurs when one partner pushes to discuss a problem, while the other avoids or disengages from the conversation.\n\nThe researchers found that couples who displayed higher levels of demand-withdrawal during their sexual conflict discussions reported lower levels of relationship and sexual satisfaction at the time of the discussion (known as Time 1) and 12 months later (Time 2). These couples also reported higher levels of sexual distress at the time of the discussion, though the effect on sexual distress did not persist 12 months later.\n\nInterestingly, the researchers found that higher levels of demand-withdrawal communication were associated with reduced relationship satisfaction over time. Couples who engaged in more demand-withdrawal behavior during their sexual conflict discussion experienced a decline in their relationship satisfaction over the following year.

(around the beginning of evolution of primates)', 'THE FULL PAPERS:  [https://iopscience.iop.org/journal/2041-8205](https://iopscience.iop.org/journal/2041-8205) \n\nNO APOLOGIES FOR CAPS LOCK TODAY', 'Radio astronomer here!  This is *huge* news! (I know we say that a lot in astronomy, but honestly, we are lucky enough to live in very exciting times for astronomy!) First of all, while the existence of black holes has been accepted for a long time in astronomy, it\'s one thing to see effects from them (LIGO seeing them smash into each other, [see stars orbit them](https://www.reddit.com/r/educationalgifs/comments/bb6gj8/trajectories_of_stars_orbiting_the_supermassive/), etc) and another to *actually get a friggin\' image of one*.  Even if to the untrained eye it looks like a donut- let me explain why!\n\nNow what the image shows is not of the hole itself, as gravity is so strong light can\'t escape there, but related to a special area called the [event horizon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_horizon), which is basically the ""point of no return"" after which you cannot escape. (It should be noted that the black hole is *not* actively sucking things into it like a vacuum, just like the sun isn\'t actively sucking the Earth into it.) As such, what we are really seeing here is not the black hole itself- light can\'t escape once within the event horizon- but rather all the matter swirling around and falling in.  In the case of the M87 black hole, it\'s estimated about 90 Earth masses of material falls onto it every day, so there is plenty to see relative to our own [Sag A*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittarius_A*).\n\nNow, on a more fundamental level than ""it\'s cool to have a picture of a black hole,"" there are a ton of unresolved questions about fundamental physics that this result can shed a relatively large amount on.  First of all, the entire event horizon is an insanely neat result predicted by general relativity (GR) to happen in extreme environments, so to actually see that is a great confirmation of GR.  Beyond that, general relativity breaks down when so much mass is concentrated at a point that light cannot escape, in what is called a [gravitational singularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_singularity), where you treat it as having infinite density when using general relativity.  We don\'t think it literally is infinite density, but rather that our understanding of physics breaks down. (There are also several secondary things we don\'t understand about black hole environments, like the mechanism of how [relativistic jets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysical_jet) get beamed out of some black holes.) We are literally talking about a regime of physics that Einstein didn\'t understand, and that we can\'t test in a lab on Earth because it\'s so extreme, and there is literally a booming sub-field of theoretical astrophysics trying to figure out these questions.  Can you imagine how much our understanding of relativity is going to change now that we actually have *direct imaging* of an event horizon?  It\'s priceless!\n\nThird, this is going to reveal my bias as a radio astronomer, but... guys, this measurement and analysis was amazingly *hard* and I am in awe of the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) team and their tenacity in getting this done.  I know several of the team and remember how dismissed the idea was when first proposed, and [have observed at one of the telescopes used for the EHT](https://www.reddit.com/r/Andromeda321/comments/8tfhgr/guess_whos_observing_tonight_at_the_submillimeter/) (for another project), and wanted to shed a little more on just why this is an amazing achievement.   Imagine placing an orange on the moon, and deciding you want to resolve it from all the other rocks and craters with your naked eye- *that* is how detailed this measurement had to be to resolve the event horizon.  To get that resolution, you literally have to link radio telescopes across the planet, from Antarctica to Hawaii, by calibrating each one\'s data (after it\'s shipped to you from the South Pole, of course- Internet\'s too slow down there), getting rid of systematics, and then co-adding the data.  This is so incredibly difficult I\'m frankly amazed they got this image in as short a time as they did! (And frankly, I\'m not surprised that one of their two targets proved to be too troublesome to debut today- getting even this one is a Nobel Prize worthy accomplishment.)\n\nA final note on that- why M87?  Why is that more interesting than the black hole at the center of the galaxy?  Well, it turns out even with the insanely good resolution of the EHT, which is the best we can do until we get radio telescopes in space as it\'s limited by the size of our planet, there are only two black holes we can resolve.  Sag A*, the supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy that clocks in at 4 million times the mass of the sun, we can obviously do because it\'s relatively nearby at ""only"" 25,000 light years away.  M87\'s black hole, on the other hand, is 7 billion times the mass of the sun, or 1,700 *times* bigger than our own galaxy\'s supermassive black hole.  This meant its effective size was half as big as Sag A* in in the sky despite being 2,700 times the distance (it\'s ~54 million light years).  The reason it\'s cool though is it\'s such a monster that it M87 emits these giant jets of material, unlike Sag A*, so there\'s going to now be a ton of information in how those work!\n\nAnyway, this is long enough, but I hope you guys are as excited about this as I am and this post helps explain the gravity of the situation!  It\'s amazing both on a scientific and technical level that we can achieve this!\n\nTL;DR- This is a big deal scientifically because we can see an event horizon and test where general relativity breaks down, but also because technically this was super duper hard to do.  Will win the Nobel Prize in the next few years.\n\nEdit: A lot of questions about why Sag A* wasn\'t also revealed today.  Per someone I know really involved in one of the telescopes, the weather was not as good at all the telescopes as it was for the M87 observation (even small amounts of water vapor in the air absorb some of the signal at these frequencies), and the foregrounds are much more complicated for Sag A* that you need to subtract.  It\'s not yet clear to me whether data from that run will still be usable, or they will need to retake it.', '[removed]', ""May someone please ELI5 what we're seeing and the signifance?"", 'Neat that the Doppler shift on one side is so clear.

17,top,science,Raising the taxes of graduate students by as much as 300% will be a disaster for the USA,"Science and technology development has been the story of the past 100 years.  The discoveries and innovations are progressing at a dazzling rate, much of this lead by researchers at universities in the USA.  At these universities, a substantial amount of the work is done by graduate students, who work long hours (80 hours weeks aren't unusual) for little pay.  These graduate students go on to work in good paying jobs, where their innovations make more jobs for others.  


Start-ups develop to bring new innovations based on the skills graduate students learn (Google was the project of a couple of Stanford grad students, even Reddit benefited from the skills of a physics grad student/PhD, /u/keysersosa, the current CTO.)  Grad school has been for decades a path to prosperity for  those who come from humble beginnings but are willing to work hard, and make sacrifices, a system that has greatly benefited all of us.


This is why we scientists are shocked and appalled by the recently passed tax bill in congress which will result in the tax bills of already poor grad students [going up by as much as 300%](http://fortune.com/2017/11/08/graduate-students-say-gop-tax-plan-could-increase-their-taxes-by-nearly-300/), which would see their take-home pay drop by 25%. As a former grad student myself, I can tell you that I would not have been able to continue if my pay had be reduced by $7,000, and many students would make the same conclusion.  Instead, some will not go into science or they will leave the USA to be a grad student in Europe or Asia, most of these students will never return to the USA. 


This is why every major science organization has [voiced opposition to the current tax plan](https://www.aaas.org/sites/default/files/AAAS%20Multisociety%20Letter%20on%20Tax%20Reform.pdf?D1fnCM0H.C.qegz_Yo2wJwPV7IWBzuGy), make no mistake, this plan will [undermine research and eventually the economy of the USA](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-017-05925-6).

In comic form from [PhD Comics](http://phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1985).


What can we do to stop it?  Call your representatives in congress and let them know.  It hasn't passed yet, but it's about to.  If we don't raise voices now, we will all regret it.

That was money I made and it was only appropriate. \n\nThat is not what this is about.\n\nBut I never saw a dime of the $30k my university charged for tuition even in years when I wasn't taking coursework. They write themselves a credit for allowing me to be enrolled regardless of how I used that enrollment. For example, when I took a semester for maternity leave I had to stay enrolled. Thankfully my university covered my tuition that semester while I stayed home with the kid. \n\nIf that had not been the case I would have been taxed on $15k that semester while I didn't take a single course, attend a single lecture, use the library, or anything else.

They just ""forgive"" the tuition fee, thus allowing them to pay lower wages, because students don\'t have to require wages to pay that tuition out of.\n\nFor the system that means basically the tuition gets removed from the system twice. As part of the wage, and as part of the revenue of the universities.\n\n**The outrage**: Taxing things that you DIDN\'T pay. If that logic was broadly applied, homeless people would have to pay taxes for meals received at the soup kitchen. If you get anything for free as promotion, or gift. that would all have to be declared as income. Which is on one level ludicrous. (even more absurdly: Technically if you get a tax deduction, it would have to be counted as taxable income, which is the outcome of taxing things you DIDN\'T earn.....). It creates a giant question mark in terms of ""perks of a job"". What kind of benefits to you by having a certain job should be quantified and taxed? How about a company car? Do you have to declare that? Do you apply ""common leasing rates""?\n\n**The justification**: You can\'t just remove ANY gift from taxation, because it allows for massive tax evasion. There is a difference for the system whether you get peanuts as wages but board and food as ""gift"", or getting a proper wage that gets taxed and have to PAY for accommodation and for your food (each being taxed as income for the provider)\n\nIn this case the universities basically are skirting their dues by artificially reducing their revenue (tuition fees not taken in) but compensating it with lower wages, thus reducing the payroll tax on the students side.\n\n**The flaw**:\nTHe flaw is that this AGAIN is  putting the pressure on the weakest people IN this situation, by now taxing the forgiven tuition as income, as IF they had received it as income and then paid it, thus making receiving the waiver unattractive, thus forcing the students to demand wages that allows them to PAY the tuition, which then gets taxed as revenue on the universities side.  \nedit: Additional flaw: It doesn\'t work. The workaround for the university is to increase the wages by JUST the amount the students have to pay as taxes, this STILL doesn\'t force them to pay taxes on their forgiven revenue (basically implying that universities are lobbying hard enough to skirt THAT part of the problem)\n\n**Solution**: If the goal is to prevent universities to apply this trick, but not want to punish the students, the tuition would have to be tax deductible. Basically the whole problem only arises because of for-profit education to begin with.\n\n**Additional observation**:\nThe above is independent from observations or disagreement of how the actual tax burden is distributed in the US. It doesn\'t address how the worst offenders against the common good get the most lenient tax deductions and lowest taxes, or why specifically for profit education is under the microscope here, rather than other ways to avoid contributing to society.\n\n**Tl;dr** :\n\nJust calling it a 300% increase is dishonest and misses the issue in an effort to foster outrage.', 'This is indicative of a bigger problem, in my opinion.

So they basically pay taxes on money they\'ve never seen and never will see. \n2) REPEALS THE STUDENT INTEREST LOAN DEDUCTION. EVERYONE with student loans who makes under 80k (160K) for couples should be against this. It takes away $2500 of deductible income from you every year. \n3) FREE TUITION BENEFITS FOR FAMILY MEMBERS GET TAXED AS INCOME.

If you have any knowledge of how economics works this will make sense to you. \n\nThink about the reason WHY education is so expensive in the first place. It’s obviously not because people can actually afford to pay for it on average, that’s why there is so much debt. It’s because the government gives millions upon millions in student loans every year, giving the illusion that people actually can pay. The government is allowing people to spend money to get something they can’t afford, and since it’s now the government’s loan money being spent, schools can drive tuition fees as high as they dare. Now, let’s say that the government does what it is doing here. In the very short term, the cost of education will seemingly skyrocket, and like many people here in the comments are echoing the sentiments of, many students will be simply unable to pay. However, what will be the effect of this? In economics, when the price increases, there is a movement left along the demand curve and right along the supply curve, and there exists a surplus of supply, where few consumers will pay at the current price.  Therefore, since universities are now not selling their profit maximizing amount, which is more or less at the market equilibrium price where most people can pay to go to school, schools will be FORCED TO DROP PRICES in order to encourage more people to attend them and bring in more revenue to stay afloat. Taking these market effects into account, in the long run this new tax bill will actually benefit the majority of consumers. \n\nNow in the short run, maybe say the next 2-3 years this will absolutely hurt students and hurt the advancement of science and higher education. That’s exactly why so many people will resist this tax bill, and why it is the GOP suggesting the bill.

It would then be considered taxable income in the same way that lottery winners or game show winners are taxed on their winnings.\n\nWhen tuition waivers are taxed, schools have to give larger stipends to continue the same level of incentives, resulting in essentially the same series of cause and effect as I explained earlier.\n\nIf you want to have civil debate about this with me, please reply, since it can only help everyone understand the issue more clearly and in greater detail.

Please show REAL, actionable support, or this injustice for current and future Americans is going to happen. ', 'My father, who has an M.S. Eng. and is a moderate conservative was telling me his opinion about eliminating 117(d). Though I don’t buy into it all, he makes some interesting points:\n\n“1) Whether the impact is real or not (notice they used out of state grad students to maximize the impact and don’t discuss the impact of other provisions, some of which could benefit grad students, like lower tax rates in general, larger exemptions, better job opps due to tax reform stimulating growth), if you want to oppose the change, I suggest you do just that…oppose the elimination of 117(d), not the entire bill.  If you oppose the entire bill because of one provision, you are playing into the hands of the group of vested special interest groups that don’t want to see their gravy train ended:  unions, mortgage bankers, home builders, realtors, big pharma, wind companies, oil companies, ship builders, etc etc… Our tax code creates perverse incentives that cause lots of non-productive activities.  For an eye opener, google “realtors oppose elimination of mortgage interest deduction”…you’ll find their reasoning is “doing so would cause house prices to drop, leading to a reduction in income for realtors and causing some realtors to leave the profession”.  How is that bad for America?  Oh yeah, I guess if you’re trying to sell a house…of course, that means your next house purchase is cheaper also!\n\n2) The problem with our tax code is all of the thousands of special interest groups that have carved out special provisions for themselves, leaving the poor “not special interest” groups to pay the bill.  The tax code needs serious reform (as does our government bureaucracy, but that\'s for another day!), and the best way is to wipe it clean.  Believe it or not, it wasn’t poor graduate students that got 117(d) put in place (poor grad students really don’t have any power!)…it was greedy college administrators who got those provisions in so that they didn’t have to keep their tuition rates reasonable and affordable…they could rely on “the taxpayers” of the US to help pay their inflated tuitions, which they then used to enrich themselves.  Check out the budgets of major universities and administrators salaries (say, as a multiple of annual tuition!), and compare that to the time that John and I were in school, if you don’t think administration have gotten fat, dumb, and rich.  The fundraising department (“Office of Development”) at [my alma mater] is bigger than the entire executive administration was when I went there.\n\n3) If 117(d) is eliminated (tuition reductions become taxable for “employees”), colleges won’t allow their grad students to leave because they can’t afford it.  To do so would damage their schools, and shut down their graduate programs…they can reduce their tuitions for grad students, which no government can control, or they can use scholarships and grants, which are nontaxable under 117(a) - (c), and which are NOT being eliminated in the House bill.\n\nHaving said all of that, the stink about 117(d) is loud enough (and the “victims"" vulnerable enough!)  that the Senate bill will probably leave it in, and House members will probably keep it in during reconciliation!  Just my prediction… “\n\nTL;DR: my conservative Dad thinks:\n1)You should specifically write to oppose only the elimination of 117(d) and not the entire bill or else you’re  playing into the hands of the group of vested special interest groups that don’t want to see their gravy train ended\n2) It was greedy college administrators who got those provisions (117(d) specifically) in so that they didn’t have to keep their tuition rates reasonable and affordable\n3)Universities will lower tuition and use scholarships / grants (still nontaxable) more often if 117(d) is eliminated \n\nThoughts?', 'Great points raised.\n\nMy only concern is that there is a high demand for grad school spots and low supply.

Both secular and religious.  It may take a little networking, but tons of people have left their estates to small and large schools solely to pay the tuition to those that can\'t afford it.  The key here is networking with alumni and everyone you can in admissions and at the executive level. Set up interviews.  If they like you and see your initiative, all of a sudden they\'ll pull out a file on something like ""Mr Write\'s Student Charity"" and tell you to write or meet with someone and money will appear appear almost magically.  My family operates one of these foundations, and there are tons of others like them.  We use it to pay for our own kids tuitions to catholic schools and other kids.  We are not a wealthy family, My Grandfather set up a fund years ago instead of giving my Dad a small inheritance to insure his grandchildren would go to Catholic school.   It was funded with  a few thousand dollars and the money was put in conservative investments.  The only requirement is that someone is going to a catholic school and they contact us.\n\nEveryone always forgets networking.\nThis is why low tax wanting citizens often want low taxes, they already have social safety nets in place.  The government wants to cut out private safety nets built on personal relationships because they want people divided, and they want people to not be united together by personal bonds.  They want the government to fulfill the role the church, neighborhoods and membership organizations fulfilled.  \n\nAnother avenue to look is get a job at a decent local business that can\'t attract talent.  Sometimes the local drug store of toy store is doing very well financially but isn\'t a big name like target that everyone wants to go work for, so they send their employees to college when they graduate highschool if they want to keep them around and agree to work for a year or two.\n\nYou can\'t fill out a government application and have your dreams come true.

And the US desperately needs people to go after these degrees.\n\nFrom my perspective, I worked between 10-14 hours, 6 days a week. On a busy week I was averaging 90+ hours per week in the lab. It\'s a really competitive, nasty work environment. But for one thing, these people are essential for the continuance of college programs as they provide guidance to undergrads and act as professors. Second, no one advocates for them so they are seen as expendable.

We pride ourselves on being forward thinking and industry-minded while simultaneously taking steps to cripple the next generation of thinkers and discourage potential savants from entering fields that they could excel at.\n\nLikewise, if we actually want to compete and engage globally, we probably need to be a place where graduate students can afford to survive. In my graduate program, rent and utilities were about $19,800 a year, coming from a salary of $25,000 a year. Thus I had maybe a few thousand left over after taxes.

Forget it. Let\'s pretend every single one of them has every single dollar of their tuition waived.\n\nAverage PhD tuition in the US is $16,000 annually according to the National Center for Education Statistics. But the TCaJA2k17 only taxes tuition waivers above around $5,000 annually. So - now counting as income - we have an extra 1 million people earning, roughly, $11,000 more per year.\n\nLet\'s assume this bumps them all up into the 15% marginal tax bracket.

AFAIK All PhD students get tuition waivers provided that they are registered as full-time students (more on that below) and work for the university in the capacity expected of a PhD student (e.g. TA, GRA, AI, etc.).  You\'re expected to put in 20 hours / week on your employed capacity, and spend any remaining time towards your research (which is also to benefit the university).

Not waiving it would basically be the university saying ""hey man please come work for us for seven years, you get shit benefits and no time off and negative dollars, how does that sound?"".\n\nFor PhD students, tuition is basically a nonsensical formality anyway: tuition is calculated per classes you register for (""full-time"" student is a ""9 hour"" student, which means registering for three 3-hour-per-week classes), and since PhD students don\'t actually take any classes, we are required to triple-register for the ""fake-class-that-meets-for-3-hours-every-week-except-it-doesn\'t-because-it-doesn\'t-exist"" class every semester. This is what classifies us as a full-time student so that the university is able to consider our work as being towards a degree at their institution, but consequently also results in our tuition fees. Most of the tuition fees are then waived.', 'In that case, why doesn’t the university just reduce the rack rate of tuition for PhD programs to remove the taxable value of the waiver?

However, this tax abstention by and large exists exclusively for undergraduate education.\n\nGraduate students by and large work over 40 hours a week. It is not abnormal to consistently push 60. There is a misconception that all we do is schoolwork and research in pursuit of our own degree. This is false. A significant portion of grad students' time, at minimum 20 hours a week, again frequently around 40, is essentially working for the university. TAs do the jobs professors once did at a fraction of the cost. Nearly every student works on research not relevant to their thesis that does not directly contribute to them graduating. This is work for the university, for the principal investigator, for whoever funded the research. This is in addition to the research for their thesis or dissertation.\n\nGrad students significantly reduce the cost of doing research in all fields.

If the intergenerational persistence of income was equal to one, that income advantage would be transferred in whole to the next generation. That is, the children of the richest fifth would have 12 times as much income as the children of the poorest fifth. If the intergenerational persis- tence of income were equal to zero, none of that advantage would be present among the children of these groups. Corak reported that U.S. estimates of the elasticity vary in the range of 0.4–0.6, corresponding to an inherited income advantage of between 2.70 and 4.44 for the richest fifth compared to the poorest fifth. Elasticity at these levels means that the children whose parents were among the richest fifth (i.e., parents whose income was 12 times that of the poorest fifth) grow up to earn about 3 to 4 times as much as the children whose parents were among the poorest fifth. Thus, their income advantage was roughly half that of their parents.\nhttp://www.irp.wisc.edu/publications/focus/pdfs/foc262g.pdf\n\n"", ""I guess I'm struggling to see the relevance.

NIH payline is below 10%, meaning that out of 100 grants submitted (which is a complete pain in the ass and often takes a year to do), only 10 make it.

Having far more competitive schools is also a good start.

When Alabama cut its state funding for police services they engineered a private, overtly religious police force.\nThis is the example that came to mind when I read your comment. \nOne could make the same correlation between taxes/government budgets and the privatization of a host of other government services (fire departments, prisons, safety regulation enforcement, etc....) \nI don’t think it’s possible fund a civil society not engineer it.\n', ""As a matter of interpretation, sure. That is the result of any funding decision. But it isn't black and white. \n\nWhen you have a situation where half the country is paying no federal income taxes, then they complain that any tax cut doesn't go to them but to the half that are paying it. Surprise!\n\nI actually believe that EVERYONE should be participants in the system. Every person in the country should be a stakeholder. They way to do that is a flat tax of one sort or another that applies to all income at the same rate. If you want to go a VAT route instead, fine, I could be swayed to that as well - as long as it is a replacement not an addition. \n\nThere shouldn't be deductions for home mortgage interest, tuition, children or anything else. You make this much, you pay this, you're done. No progressive nature at all. People who produce more (which is a societal good) will pay more in dollars anyway. \n\nIt would be cheaper to execute, easier to comply with, and introduce stability that transcends whomever is in the House at the time. \n"", 'I’d agree to what you’re proposing in theory, with two caveats.\n1. That the people who produce the most (economically anyway) aren’t necessarily the people who pay the most taxes. Nor are they necessarily the most robust economic contributors. The Paradise Papers are only the most recent exposure of the long and shady history of the fabulously wealthy locking assets away from local economies and tax bases. \n2. In a world where tax incentives already exist to incentivize investment, how could we engineer a solution that both cuts itemized tax deductions without cutting investment? \nFor example : Home ownership is the single biggest asset of vast majority of middle class Americans. Homeownership is also a positive indicator of a healthy local tax base and all the goodies that come with that: schools, infrastructure, services, etc... \nThe mortgage interest deduction figures prominently in many home buying decisions and the family budget for years after the purchase.\nSans the interest deduction what would a home ownership economic incentive look like? If you were to legislate away the interest deduction many Americans would be saddled with homes they could no longer afford, setting the economy up for another major debit default.\nI think this is probably a very similar scenario we are setting our selves up for with student debit. ', ""If you bought a home based on deductibility of the interest then our couldn't afford that house anyway. This is exactly the problem with perverse incentives driven by tax policy rather than personal economic realities. \n\nThe incentive for home ownership is that it locks in your housing expense for the long term. \n\nAnd yes, I would argue that income is tied to the productivity of the person in an economic sense.\n\nThere's lots of evidence historically that when the tax system and rates are perceived as fair, then people stop dodging it.\n\n"", 'I personally I hope that they don’t cut my deductions without some kind of plan to help people like me that depend on them over that economic hurdle.\nAs a small business owner with employees in New York State I pay so much in taxes.\nAt least we can agree that the tax code as it stands now is much too complicated. \nVery nice debating with you and have a good holiday!

Sixty-three percent of Americans don’t have enough to cover a $500 emergency.\n> \n> When they become parents, they are faced with a new price tag: childcare for only one infant takes up 17.6 percent of a typical family’s income in Arizona, according to the Economic Policy Institute. \n> \n> For years our economy has been stifled by an outdated, broken tax code that is 74,000 pages long and filled with loopholes, handouts, and bailouts for special interests. It rewards lawyers and lobbyists — not hardworking families. Sky-high rates penalize the success of main street job creators, driving up the price of goods and services for everyone. \n> \n> Globally high tax rates send jobs overseas, making it harder to find good employment that supports your family. The IRS picks winners and losers. Inefficient federal programs run by Washington bureaucrats take and waste families’ hard-earned dollars. It doesn’t take an economist to see our current tax code is keeping wages stagnant, our economy slow and families living paycheck to paycheck. \n> \n> Bill slashes taxes, closes loopholes\n> \n> Taxpayers deserve a tax code that is simpler, flatter and fairer, so that every American family and employer can file their taxes without paying astronomical compliance costs.\n> \n> The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that the House passed on Thursday with my support will bring historic relief — slashing taxes, closing loopholes, fostering job growth, allowing America to compete and win in a global economy, and putting more money back into your paycheck.\n> \n> While there are many ways to measure how this plan will help Arizonans, the most important metric is how it will impact hard-working families like yours. Washington needs to respect your family by rewarding your hard work and returning your money. \n> \n> These tax cuts will save the typical family of four in Arizona $1,182 every year. How? Our plan simplifies and lowers income tax rates for low and middle-income Americans, nearly doubles the standard deduction, increases tax credits for children, and preserves the mortgage interest and charitable contribution deductions. In fact, a family of four making $55,000 a year will pay no federal taxes at all. \n> \n> What could your family do with those thousands of dollars that Washington used to take?\n> \n> How reforms help working families\n> \n> This legislation will help working families overcome the challenges they face in our modern economy, like the burdensome cost of childcare. Sixty-one percent of children under 5 are regularly in childcare, and it often costs more than college.\n> \n> As founder and chairwoman of the Working Group on Women in the 21st Century Workforce, I’ve heard firsthand about this obstacle from working women who are trying to make ends meet, provide for their families and meet their full potential. \n> \n> That’s why I fought hard to ensure that the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit was restored in the legislation the House drafted — and I won. Now our plan not only protects the child tax credit, but also increases it by 60 percent and includes a new Family Flexibility Credit. \n> \n> Additionally, this legislation supports parents by streamlining higher education benefits so families can save for college and other education expenses. Finally, it preserves and protects critical retirement savings options like tax-free 401(k) plans and Individual Retirement Accounts so that hard workers like you can save for a financially secure future.\n> \n> The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act also helps Arizonans by promoting a healthy economy that has more job opportunities with higher wages and benefits. Take the Ruiz family in Tucson, which specializes in metal distribution and employs five people, but wants to grow. They currently own only one waterjet machine. When it breaks down, their team is forced to work later hours to make up for lost time. \n> \n> Plan will help local businesses expand\n> \n> The Ruizes’ story is similar to many I’ve heard while hosting roundtables, visiting local businesses and listening to constituents throughout my district. Employers of diverse industries, sizes and cities have all voiced a united theme: taxes are suffocating them, and they need this relief.\n> \n> Small employers currently face tax rates as high as 44.6 percent. The tax code is so complex that businesses spend an estimated $147 billion every year filing tax returns.\n> \n> Our plan will reduce the tax rate for job creators and simplify the tax code so Arizona employers can focus on their customers, take care of their employees and create more jobs. It also allows employers to immediately and fully expense new equipment. \n> \n> For the Ruiz family, this means finally being able to invest in another waterjet machine, and even upgrade their old computer system. In Carlos Ruiz’s words, “Additional equipment increases my capacity to grow my business and serve more customers. That means I can increase the skills and pay of my current employees, and hire more people.”\n> \n> This legislation will help hard working families in Arizona make — and keep — more of their hard earned money, and that’s why I voted for it. The last time the tax code was overhauled was 31 years ago. It’s time we give taxpayers and job creators the biggest boost this country has had in a generation.

I\'ve always wondered if that played into the halo effect as well (e.g. a male supervisor looking to sexualize an employee but holds off on women he views as other men\'s property or ruined by motherhood vs men needing to be breadwinners to provide for his wife and children.)\n\nThe halo effect causes massive disparities in pay even without counting for racial/gender disparities.

Generally, it is difficult to disentangle the reasons behind why beauty improves productivity (Hamermesh and Parker, 2005). However, relative to other students, attractive men are more successful in peer influence, and are more persistent, a personality trait positively linked to academic outcomes (Dion and Stein, 1978, Alan et al., 2019).

Importantly, possession of these traits is significantly linked to creativity (Soda et al., 2021). In our setting, the tasks faced by students in non-quantitative subjects, for instance in marketing and supply chain management, are likely to be seen as more ”creative”, and significantly contrast the more traditional book-reading and problem-solving in mathematics and physics courses, the latter presumably perceived as more monotonous.

You should also have a control group that does not play video games to prove that violence doesn't naturally increase over those three years.

I analyzed and compared data from a multitude of studies on violent behaviors linked to violence in TV and Video games. and the results were good and bad.\n\nViolent video games lead to *desensitization*of the perception of violence. Acting out the violent acts in video games tends to not directly cause further acts of violence among the general population. But those susceptible to violent behavior already will find that violent video games will provide an outlet to increase that desensitization and thus increase the likelihood of a violent person acting on the desensitized standard of violence that may be depicted in video games. In addition to this, younger kids playing violent video games experience an exacerbated desensitization compared to an adult.\n\nTelevision violence increases desensitization as well but less so compared to video games. But an interesting result was that the most contributing factor to future violent behavior was emulation of violent icons in TV. This was most evident in young kids that looked to movie stars such as Stalone or Arnold or other action TV stars that used violence as a mean of *solving problems*. This lesson has been shown to stick into adulthood with longitudinal studies proving that those children obsessed over TV or movie icons that used violence as a means of solving problems have directly contributed to their likelihood of committing violent crimes, marital violence, or having anger problems.\n\nThe problem here is children being exposed to violence in video games or TV (especially violent icons) are more likely to be violent of have anger issues later in life. This is what studies have shown. But *however,* Adult studies that were exposed to this  same kind violence later in life posed little correlative proof of leading to violence. \n\nThe most important lesson to glean from this is that kids should be controlled with what violent media they consume because they misconstrue violence as an answer to problems and their psyche is weaker than that of an adults. They can experience desensitization far easier than an adult because an adult can make a complete sense of what is going on, the objective and motivation behind violence. \n\nAlthough the answer isn't what we all want to hear, my opinion is that as an adult I can enjoy violent video games and TV even though it may desensitize me somewhat, but directly feeding this to a child without supervision or providing context to violence could have very negative effects in the future."", 'I feel like this report comes out once a year.

Articles like this prove a point but statements like this are dangerous. I’ve always believed that video games may not cause the psychosis to start but yes video games can contribute to violent behavior just as music can. Obviously it’s not the main cause but an outlying source that may cause a problem. Imagine for a moment that a 9 year old plays GTA every day after school for years, now if he had proper parenting and guidelines like most children he wouldn’t be as effected in fact he wouldn’t be playing GTA but we all know kids do.

I don’t believe video games are the main contributing factor but it does allow anger or hatred to surface in a different way. Another example would be the use of marijuana and addiction. Now I smoke and have since I was 18 on and off. I enjoy it and have friends that do as well. I hear all the time online and in conversations that weed has zero addictive properties but that’s ridiculous. It’s used as a crutch daily by many and slowly some people and I mean a very small percent use it to mask problems or escape and over time slowly become addicted to it. We all have seen it before with friends that smoke daily and then become anti social. Hence why most smokers take breaks. So what I’m getting at is when you try to say that there’s no link between games and violence it is absolutely ridiculous.

Maybe it will go well and the kid learns something by 'itself', or maybe the kid will cut him- or herself. No permanent damage done but it hurts a ton and could've been avoided. What I'm getting at is too many adults give their children a game without thinking about it, without knowing anything about it; without helping the child understand or process the game. Then again, I feel like parents shouldn't give their kids games that clearly are intended for more 'mature audiences', that have the ability to deal with graphic violence / sex / drugs /rock n' roll. But if you do, make sure you know what the game is about and make it an informed decision to buy it.\n\nThen there is the subject of children with different diagnosis (mainly thinking about adhd). They have, depending on the 'level'of adhd (sorry couldn't think of a better / correct term), a more difficulty processing these kinds of games and a harder time separating where lines are drawn. Ofcourse this depends on the individual, but very often a common denominator with these children is that they have a harder time knowing where the line is for play and when it gets serious. And that is, in my opinion, one of the harder things to deal with, especially when parents just isn't informed about games.

These are high quality studies that add to our understanding of the ideas they address, but there are several important caveats to the findings that deserve note.\n\n* The linked article refers to two different publications, only one of which bears directly on the video game-violence hypothesis. The dependent variable in the experiments conducted in the ""No Priming in Video Games"" paper is how quickly participants can classify images of vehicles and animals (i.e. their reaction time). When they say no evidence of priming, they mean it for that specific task. There are credible arguments as to why this is not generalizable to priming violence--arguments the authors acknowledge.\n* The other paper, ""*Behavioral realism and the activation of aggressive concepts in violent video games*,"" examines the video game-violence hypothesis more directly. It reports two experiments, one examining the effect of realistic ""ragdoll"" physics and the other examining the effect of more games with more realistic non-player character behavior.\n* The *Behavioral Realism* experiments are interested in the effects of specific aspects of games, so they compare the effect of violent video game A to violent video game B--all participants played violent video games. So, the paper provides evidence that ragdoll physics and realistic opponent behaviors do not **uniquely** activate aggression relative to similar games without those features. The study does **NOT** test the general hypothesis that violent video games cause violent or aggressive behavior.\n* A significant limitation in any study of this kind is statistical power. Statistical power refers to the ability to detect an effect of a given size assuming that it exists. Power varies as a function of the statistical tool being used, the design of the study, the sample size, and the size of the effect. The sample sizes in the priming paper are very small, and it\'s entirely possible that an effect did occur but was not detectable.\n* Compounding the statistical power problem is that the theoretically expected effect of any kind of media use or exposure is very small. The researchers who argue that video games cause violence argue that games cultivate aggressive tendencies gradually over time. That explanation could be 100% correct, but have almost no statistically detectable effect in a single exposure experiment. To oversimplify, if every hour of violent gameplay increased one\'s chances of committing a violent crime by 0.0001%, only aggregate, long-term effects would be realistically detectable (and, of course, studies of that kind struggle to provide convincing evidence of causality).\n\nTL;DR: The studies don\'t say what you think they say, and social science is hard.', 'Looks like an interesting experiment, but is there a good survey study out there?

Some directions of study ultimately prove to be expressions of culture, instead of anything scientific.

On the sporting fields all across the world we see images of grown men and women spitting, shouting, fighting, cheering, hugging, loving, and somehow that is beauty and real life. Having emotions is for grownups, right? And how come we\'re pinning down aggression as this uniformly problematic feeling? Video games are finally evolving in emotive, beautifully designed experiences and people continue asking if young persons at the same time of being desensitized also might be made to be too aggressive. Any semi-insightful philosophical meditation will tell you that that seems paradoxical. But that\'s not even my point: this discussion will finally end when old people stop dictating the discourse.

What the article does instead is the following entirely predictable thing:\n\n>I think we can mostly agree that this is bad. As those of us that click through to the articles know well enough, headlines are very often poor representations of the substance of the content within. Moreover, it adds an interesting twist to discussions of fake news sites. We’re often befuddled by the traction that obvious, malignant bullshit gets online, but that obviousness—including literal satire disclaimers—doesn’t often percolate upward to headlines. One might even say that headline browsers are in some part responsible for giving the US its headline president.\n\nWell no, I don\'t at all agree that this is generically bad. It\'s hugely context dependent. A discussion of which kinds of headlines necessitate which kinds of behavior would have been delightful instead of this concluding paragraph. I think the article itself is a great example of an exception to the suggested rule that skipping reading the article is bad. The article contained what it said on the tin, which is fine. It added nothing else for me personally so reading it would have been bad (for me, which it was, but meta).\n\nIt may be true that the way people vote on headlines is causing a  problem in terms of how people perceive reality (needs separate study), in what they consider to be true (needs separate study), in the way the entrench their political or ideological believes and behaviors (needs 50 more studies), etc.., but what we need is a thoughtful consideration of *why* this is so and how this headline-upvoting behavior fits into a larger context of how we\'re all being manipulated by the forms and substance of content online. To me it seems like a tiny tiny part of this larger issue (see political ads on facebook, the facebook bubble, twitterstorms, etc..).\n\nThat said I don\'t usually vote on articles but rather on decent-to-good comments, and I can only think of a few instances where I would have voted on a topic blindly: When the topic is a statement of a plan of action like ""Join the fight to protect Net Neutrality: Details inside of what you can do to help"". In that case I want to support the post but am not bothered about what the article actually says *right now*.

It most certainly is not. Think about it.\n\nThere are a large group of people who are living in substandard economic conditions. A subset of this group lives with their parents.\n\nThere is also a group of people who live with their parents, though not all of them necessarily are doing so bad economically. There are plenty of reasons to live with your parents, though one of them is definitely lack of money.\n\nWhat the article is saying is that, of the entire group of people with bad finances, the people who live with their parents are having significantly less casual sex than those who aren\'t. In fact, even the people WITH money who live with their parents are having significantly less casual sex than those who are broke and living anywhere else.\n\nThe people who are broke, but not living with their parents? Their casual sex percentages are not so different from people with money who don\'t live with their parents. This is what leads us to believe that it\'s the parents part, and not the broke part, that causes them to have less sex.\n\nSimilarly, there is a large group of people who use the internet. Of those people, there is a subset who spend a large amount of time gaming. Guess which part of that group has more sex than the other?\n\nLet me give another example of something similar. I do not personally have any experimental evidence myself to support this, but suppose that I did.\n\nThere is a group of people that are smart (lets just draw an arbitrary iq line to be in this group). Of this group, there is a subset who also work hard.\n\nThere is also a group of people who have less IQ than the arbitrary line we drew. Of this group, there is also a subset of them who work hard.\n\nNow, of the smart group, those who work hard have much more ""life success"" than those who are smart and do not work hard.\n\nIf we look at the less IQ group, however, we notice that those in that group who work hard also achieve significantly more ""life success"" than those who are smart and do not work hard.\n\nThe ""life success"" difference between all people that don\'t work hard, smart or not, are similarly lower than those who do work hard.\n\nAnd for this reason, we say that there is a positive correlation between hard work and life success.
