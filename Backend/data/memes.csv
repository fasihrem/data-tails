On mobile, Firefox can run Ublock Origin too, just like on desktop, or you can install Brave. On IOS I think there is Brave browser app too. On Android you can also download the Reddit app like you usually would. Then install ReVanced from here https://github.com/revanced/revanced-manager Open the app, go to ""Patcher"", select the Reddit app, click ""Selected patches"" and check ""Hide ads"". Go back one step and click patch. Let the app work until you see an ""Install"" button. Don\'t worry if it looks stuck, just let it work.
