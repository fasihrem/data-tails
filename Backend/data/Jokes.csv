Another example might be a gaming package or skype/facetime package"", '>companies wont even do that\n\nNorth Carolina ISP Madison River Communications blocked the voice-over-internet protocol (VOIP) service Vonage. Vonage filed a complaint with the FCC after receiving a slew of customer complaints. The FCC stepped in to sanction Madison River and prevent further blocking, but it lacks the authority to stop this kind of abuse today.\n\nThe nation’s largest ISP, Comcast, began secretly blocking peer-to-peer technologies that its customers were using over its network. Users of services like BitTorrent and Gnutella were unable to connect to these services. Investigations from the Associated Press, the Electronic Frontier Foundation and others confirmed that Comcast was indeed blocking or slowing file-sharing applications without disclosing this fact to its customers.\n\nCanada’s second-largest telecommunications company, Telus, began blocking access to a server that hosted a website supporting a labor strike against the company. Researchers at Harvard and the University of Toronto found that this action resulted in Telus blocking an additional 766 unrelated sites.\n\nAT&T forced Apple to block Skype and other competing VOIP phone services on the iPhone. The wireless provider wanted to prevent iPhone users from using any application that would allow them to make calls on such “over-the-top” voice services. The Google Voice app received similar treatment from carriers like AT&T when it came on the scene.\n\nWindstream Communications, a DSL provider with more than 1 million customers at the time, copped to hijacking user-search queries made using the Google toolbar within Firefox. Users who believed they had set the browser to the search engine of their choice were redirected to Windstream’s own search portal and results.\n\nMetroPCS, at the time one of the top-five U.S. wireless carriers, announced plans to block streaming video over its 4G network from all sources except YouTube. MetroPCS then threw its weight behind Verizon’s court challenge against the FCC’s open internet ruling, hoping that rejection of the agency’s authority would allow the company to continue its anti-consumer practices.\n\nThe Electronic Frontier Foundation found that several small ISPs were redirecting search queries via the vendor Paxfire. The ISPs identified in the initial Electronic Frontier Foundation report included Cavalier, Cogent, Frontier, Fuse, DirecPC, RCN and Wide Open West. Paxfire would intercept a person’s search request at Bing and Yahoo and redirect it to another page. By skipping over the search service’s results, the participating ISPs would collect referral fees for delivering users to select websites. \n\nAT&T, Sprint and Verizon blocked Google Wallet, a mobile-payment system that competed with a similar service called ISIS, which all three companies had a stake in developing.\n\nA report from the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications found that violations of Net Neutrality affected at least one in five users in Europe. The report found that blocked or slowed connections to services like VOIP, peer-to-peer technologies, gaming applications and email were commonplace. \n\nThe FCC caught Verizon Wireless blocking people from using tethering applications on their phones. Verizon had asked Google to remove 11 free tethering applications from the Android marketplace. These applications allowed users to circumvent Verizon’s $20 tethering fee and turn their smartphones into Wi-Fi hot spots. By blocking those applications, Verizon violated a Net Neutrality pledge it made to the FCC as a condition of the airwaves auction.\n\nAT&T announced that it would disable the FaceTime video-calling app on its customers’ iPhones unless they subscribed to a more expensive text-and-voice plan. AT&T had one goal in mind: separating customers from more of their money by blocking alternatives to AT&T’s own products. \n\nDuring oral arguments in Verizon v. FCC, judges asked whether the phone giant would favor some preferred services, content or sites over others if the court overruled the agency’s existing open internet rules. Verizon counsel Helgi Walker had this to say: “I’m authorized to state from my client today that but for these rules we would be exploring those types of arrangements.” Walker’s admission might have gone unnoticed had she not repeated it on at least five separate occasions during arguments.', 'Net neutrality is nothing more than GOVERNMENT CONTROL of the internet.

The recruit follows orders, and stands by the periscope. After 15 minutes, the officer stops by.

What a whore you are, OP', 'Edit: thanks for the gold kinda stranger I didn’t expect this post to blow up! My life started growing up in a small farm in northern Kansas. My father was a farmer and my mother was a cashier in our local town down the dirt road. We didn’t have much and income was very little, my best toy I got growing up was a pig bladder blown up like a balloon that I could play around with between me and my two brothers. At the age of 11 things started getting tougher in my house life due to my fathers drinking problem as it was not a good harvest that year. Like his father before him once he was done working he would come home and drink but unlike his father he wouldn’t beat us unless we messed up, his father left him and his mother to fend for themselves after world war 2 though so he had it tougher than me growing up. One time my father did drink too much and he hit my little brother Jamey. Jamey didn’t know what to do and ran away during the night during a storm. The entire family was out looking for him but we never saw Jamey again. This made my father drink more and lead him to take his life when I was at the age of 16. My older brother and me had to completely take over the farm with the help of our mom quitting her job as a cashier, life got very hard from here on out. We got a break when I was 18 with a good harvest we were able to save up some money. I was able to move out at the age of 21 and into a larger city in Tennessee. It was hard leaving the family as my ma was getting older but my older brother completely took over the farm and even expanded it into a more profitable work. I began working in what I was good at, repairing mechanics. I was a hard worker and moved up in my chain of work easily within my town. I dated aroun’ a bit but never settled down with anyone I would write home about for my first few years. When I was 26 I got a call from my ma, my brother was working with some machinery on the farm and got his hand caught in it and heavily damaged. I had to come home and help with the farm, at the time I had attained a high position as a senior mechanic within an auto shop and sometimes worked on the side with repairing electronics. I went home and had to help with the farm for a year, ma wasn’t doing good at all. She passed the next year due to kidney disease. My brother eventually recovered and I returned to Tennessee, I attempted to return to my position but due to the time I was out I had been long replaced. I had to begin to work from the bottom again when I had a client come in, she was the most beautiful woman I ever seen in Tennessee with gorgeous brown hair. Nice to say that we hit it off pretty well, within a few weeks we were dating. I can say that she was one of the best things to have happened to me in my life. At the age of 30 I married her and my first child was on the way then. I had returned to my previous position and bought a nice house near the mountains of Tennessee. At the age of 34 my second child was born. My two kids are now both in high school, one a freshman, another a Senior. I continued my career into more electronics working on computers and fixing them. In 2013 while googling how to fix a small problem with a motherboard I found a strange site named reddit.com, this website had all the answers I needed and a community always ready to help. I’ve been on the site ever since. As you can see recently, I commented on this thread and some kind stranger gave me gold.

The extreme and disproportionate demand netflix users suddenly generated, put extreme stress on the infrastructure. Now, someone who wants high bandwidth, fast speed internet only occasionally has no good, cheap options. Netflix users put pressure on internet costs for everyone else.\n\nInfrastructure needed and continues to need additional investment to comply with this demand from a very specific customer group. The fairest way to handle that would be to have either Netflix pay directly (part of which they will put on their customers through higher prices), or their customers directly, through differential pricing by the ISP. Netflix and other datahogs like Google lobbied the Obama administration and congress to make that illegal. They complied and created ""net neutrality."" With support of well meaning activists, in good old [Bootleggers-and-Babtists fashion](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootleggers_and_Baptists).', 'But how does that address the issue of the ISP continuing to sell internet subscriptions for speeds advertised well above what they\'re capable of, in light of the high capacity traffic Netflix is demanding.\n\n At the same time, none of the customers or Netflix themselves are acting outside of their plan\'s allowed usage. They are using the service they paid for to the fullest.\n\n By throttling customers for using the internet they paid for, the ISP is essentially robbing them.\n\n It was never and still is not Netflix\' fault that ISPs are having trouble making good on their advertised speeds.\n\n> They complied and created ""net neutrality.""\n\nThey did not create net neutrality. Net neutrality has been in effect since 1934. The internet has been covered by title 2 of the communications act (net neutrality) much longer than the brief period in which is hasn\'t during the early 2,000\'s when broadband and DSL were becoming popular.\n\n The internet used to exclusively operate through dial-up phone lines. Phone lines have been registered as utilities under title 2 since 1934.\n\n The internet that gave birth to America Online, Pay Pal, Amazon, Netflix, Ebay, Google, Yahoo and various other Dot Com bubble companies was a neutral telephone based internet.\n\n When the FCC attempted to protect customers under title 1, they failed. They failed hard. They switched to title 2 because it was the only way to actually do the job our taxes pay them for.\n\nSo in answering that popular question ""what was it like before net neutrality?"" To put it simply, there was no internet back then. But in the time without net neutrality, ISPs sold plans with speeds that customers couldn\'t have. They messed with people\'s connections.
