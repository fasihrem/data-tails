[Most third-party apps have shut down](https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/30/23779519/reddit-third-party-app-shut-down-apollo-sync-baconreader-api-protest) and so have many tools relied upon by moderators and [projects for making Reddit more accessible to visually impaired users](https://www.reddit.com/r/TranscribersOfReddit/comments/14ggf8k/the_future_of_transcribers_of_reddit/). \n\nBeyond the [disastrous AMA](https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/09/reddit-ceo-doubles-down-on-attack-on-apollo-developer-in-drama-filled-ama/) by the CEO, Reddit's response has been limited to promises that this change will not affect moderation tools [^((it has)^)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BotDefense/comments/14riw76/botdefense_is_wrapping_up_operations/) and promises of [new and more-accessible first-party moderation tools](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/01/1184258201/reddit-api-accessibility-mods). Promises just like [ones they have made in response to past protests](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/142w159/askhistorians_and_uncertainty_surrounding_the/), but have consistently [failed to fulfill](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/14jm3ut/several_communities_have_surfaced_an_open_letter/jpm9e0q/). \n\nIf you want to express your strong disagreement with the API pricing change or with Reddit's response to the backlash, you may want to consider the following options:\n\n1. [Finding your favorite subreddits on other platforms](https://sub.rehab/) and participating there instead.  \n2. Refraining from using the first-party Reddit app, instead sticking to one of the few remaining third-party apps or [patching one of the apps that shut down](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1wHvqQwCYdJrQg4BKlGIVDLksPN0KpOnJWniT6PbZSrI/) if you're using an Android device.  \n3.

Cancelling your Reddit Premium subscription.  \n5. Sharing the continued news coverage of these events.  \n6.

I heard a shrieking noise that sounded like a fan belt was going on someone\'s car, and as I started to say as much, the calico kitten behind that shriek appeared out of the darkness. She ran up and nudged us both before doing three turns and purring herself to sleep at my feet. We had two other cats, and we\'re worried about her having anything which could make them sick, so we brought out some food and water and left her for the night. In the morning, she was still right where we left her on the porch. So we called our vet and got her checked out. We nicknamed her ""Minnie"" which was short for ""Petit Minou"" (""Little kitten"" in French.) The vet told us Minnie was 14 weeks old approximately, and seemed to be in good health apart from a little dehydration. So we took her in, and she\'s been a part of our family for the last two years. She is leash trained, and occasionally we will take her out for a walk, but otherwise she is an indoor cat. We\'re not sure if she was a feral or was dumped, but she loves to cuddle and groom us (especially my face at three in the morning when I would otherwise be sleeping) so I can\'t imagine that she hadn\'t had exposure to humans before.

Called in some favors, because I wasn't near my home and thus needed a rescue more in the neighbourhood of where I found her.\n\nThey came and picked her up. Next day I find a tabby kitten with a leg that was clearly misformed (birth defect or broken). Called them again and they would come pick him up later, they had an emergency with a hours old kitten first. While waiting a few hours he turned from a hissing angry little thing in a cuddly ball of fur, sleeping on my lap. When they called they were on their way I decided to do one last walk by. Found and caught 2 more kittens! So when she arrived to pick up 1, I just came walking up with 2 more very angry kitties. I ended up with 2 blood stained hands/wrists full of scratches from especially the last 2 I caught. Not a nice experience when I went to the pool after (au! chlorine), but it was worth it.

Kains attention span was a speak of dust in a windstorm, nonexistent. But my Sasha, she was the nurturing type. I used to foster baby kittens for a friend that at the time, was breeding Bengals and Sphinx. Every now and then there would be a kitten that wasn\'t thriving like it should and I would get those kittens and give them some one on one assistance. Sasha was my helper. She would come every morning when it was ""time to feed the baby"". She would wait patiently while I would feed them, and she would proceed to clean them up...needless to say, I would need to give a second little clean up because Sasha had the slobber. But it was sweet to watch. She would follow the little kitties around and make sure they didn\'t get into anything, but if they did, she would get them and bring them to me or if one would get into something she couldn\'t get it out of, she would come and get me to help them out. She was such a good mommy. I fostered one kitten that was born with a severe skeletal birth defect. We knew that the baby\'s mortality was going to be extremely short but I took her anyway so she could feel the love and warmth for the short time she would live. Sasha knew this kitten was different and she would be extra gentle with her. Needless to say the little kitten passed away one night peacefully nuzzled next to me while we swept. When Sasha came in the room that morning, she was ready to do her mommy duties and I had to tell her that the baby was gone. That she had died. Sasha laid her big head on the bed, sniffed the little blanket I had wrapped the kitten in and actually cried, which in turn got my waterworks going. Sasha pouted for several days. I took a short break from fostering for a little bit. While I understand the position these kittens are in when I get them, I\'m prepared if they don\'t make it. So, the break was more for Sashas sake. My Kaine and Sasha went over the Rainbow Bridge several years ago and I still miss them dearly. I did get another special needs kitten with the same birth defect that the other kitten had.

I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness.

It then became clear the dog had never seen stairs before either but he was incredibly smart and figured it out almost instantly although the attempts leading in to the mastery were both adorable and hilarious. That same day he was sitting on my bed which had another mirror across from it (necessity for or a 16 year old boy btw), the dog jumped from the bed to the mirror shattering it and making a huge mess.

Man is doing everything right, if you ever come across stray kittens, heres what you need to do:\n\n1. Trapping is complicated, if your not able to just pick them up, trapping js best. Leave food in an area for a little and let them find it. Then place food in the same spot but in a cat trapping cage. !Make sure to have food, water, some padding on the ground, and a towel/blanket on-top of the cage. You don’t want to roast your fur-babies alive.\n\n1. Put in a small, warm room like a bathroom, try to reduce contact with kittens and other objects and animals as much as possible, they ARE likely to have diseases such as ringworm.\n\n2. Bathe. Bathe with something anti-fungal, like lime-sulfur. \n\n3. Once old enough, neuter and spay, vaccine, chip and register.\n\n4. Find the right family. Please please PLEASE don’t just give kittens to anybody.
