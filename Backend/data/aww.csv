[Most third-party apps have shut down](https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/30/23779519/reddit-third-party-app-shut-down-apollo-sync-baconreader-api-protest) and so have many tools relied upon by moderators and [projects for making Reddit more accessible to visually impaired users](https://www.reddit.com/r/TranscribersOfReddit/comments/14ggf8k/the_future_of_transcribers_of_reddit/). \n\nBeyond the [disastrous AMA](https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/09/reddit-ceo-doubles-down-on-attack-on-apollo-developer-in-drama-filled-ama/) by the CEO, Reddit's response has been limited to promises that this change will not affect moderation tools [^((it has)^)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BotDefense/comments/14riw76/botdefense_is_wrapping_up_operations/) and promises of [new and more-accessible first-party moderation tools](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/01/1184258201/reddit-api-accessibility-mods). Promises just like [ones they have made in response to past protests](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/142w159/askhistorians_and_uncertainty_surrounding_the/), but have consistently [failed to fulfill](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/14jm3ut/several_communities_have_surfaced_an_open_letter/jpm9e0q/). \n\nIf you want to express your strong disagreement with the API pricing change or with Reddit's response to the backlash, you may want to consider the following options:\n\n1. [Finding your favorite subreddits on other platforms](https://sub.rehab/) and participating there instead.  \n2.

Kains attention span was a speak of dust in a windstorm, nonexistent. But my Sasha, she was the nurturing type. I used to foster baby kittens for a friend that at the time, was breeding Bengals and Sphinx. Every now and then there would be a kitten that wasn\'t thriving like it should and I would get those kittens and give them some one on one assistance. Sasha was my helper. She would come every morning when it was ""time to feed the baby"". She would wait patiently while I would feed them, and she would proceed to clean them up...needless to say, I would need to give a second little clean up because Sasha had the slobber. But it was sweet to watch. She would follow the little kitties around and make sure they didn\'t get into anything, but if they did, she would get them and bring them to me or if one would get into something she couldn\'t get it out of, she would come and get me to help them out. She was such a good mommy. I fostered one kitten that was born with a severe skeletal birth defect. We knew that the baby\'s mortality was going to be extremely short but I took her anyway so she could feel the love and warmth for the short time she would live. Sasha knew this kitten was different and she would be extra gentle with her. Needless to say the little kitten passed away one night peacefully nuzzled next to me while we swept. When Sasha came in the room that morning, she was ready to do her mommy duties and I had to tell her that the baby was gone. That she had died. Sasha laid her big head on the bed, sniffed the little blanket I had wrapped the kitten in and actually cried, which in turn got my waterworks going. Sasha pouted for several days. I took a short break from fostering for a little bit. While I understand the position these kittens are in when I get them, I\'m prepared if they don\'t make it. So, the break was more for Sashas sake. My Kaine and Sasha went over the Rainbow Bridge several years ago and I still miss them dearly. I did get another special needs kitten with the same birth defect that the other kitten had.

Then place food in the same spot but in a cat trapping cage. !Make sure to have food, water, some padding on the ground, and a towel/blanket on-top of the cage. You don‚Äôt want to roast your fur-babies alive.\n\n1. Put in a small, warm room like a bathroom, try to reduce contact with kittens and other objects and animals as much as possible, they ARE likely to have diseases such as ringworm.\n\n2. Bathe. Bathe with something anti-fungal, like lime-sulfur. \n\n3. Once old enough, neuter and spay, vaccine, chip and register.\n\n4. Find the right family. Please please PLEASE don‚Äôt just give kittens to anybody.
