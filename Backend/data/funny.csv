10,hot,funny,Forging A Return to Productive Conversation: An Open Letter to Reddit,"To All Whom It May Concern:

For fifteen years, /r/Funny has been one of Reddit’s most-popular communities. That time hasn’t been without its difficulties, but for the most part, we’ve all gotten along (with each other and with administrators). Members of our team fondly remember Moderator Roadshows, visits to Reddit’s headquarters, Reddit Secret Santa, April Fools’ Day events, regional meetups, and many more uplifting moments. We’ve watched this platform grow by leaps and bounds, and although we haven’t been completely happy about every change that we’ve witnessed, we’ve always done our best to work with Reddit at finding ways to adapt, compromise, and move forward. 

This process has occasionally been preceded by some exceptionally public debate, however.

On June 12th, 2023, /r/Funny joined thousands of other subreddits in protesting the planned changes to Reddit’s API; changes which – despite being immediately evident to only a minority of Redditors – threatened to worsen the site for everyone. By June 16th, 2023, that demonstration had evolved to represent a wider (and growing) array of concerns, many of which arose in response to [Reddit’s statements to journalists](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/06/16/reddit-ceo-blackout-moderators-steve-huffman/). Today (June 26th, 2023), we are hopeful that users and administrators alike can make a return to the productive dialogue that has served us in the past. 

We acknowledge that Reddit has placed itself in a situation that makes adjusting its current API roadmap impossible. 

However, we have the following requests:

- Commit to exploring ways by which third-party applications can make an affordable return.
- Commit to providing moderation tools and [accessibility options](https://www.reddit.com/r/Blind/comments/14ds81l/rblinds_meetings_with_reddit_and_the_current/) (on Old Reddit, New Reddit, and mobile platforms) which match or exceed the functionality and utility of third-party applications.
- Commit to prioritizing a significant reduction in spam, misinformation, bigotry, and illegal content on Reddit.
- Guarantee that any future developments which may impact moderators, contributors, or stakeholders will be announced no less than one fiscal quarter before they are scheduled to go into effect.
- Work together with longstanding moderators to establish a reasonable roadmap and deadline for accomplishing all of the above.
- Affirm that efforts meant to keep Reddit accountable to its commitments and deadlines will hereafter not be met with insults, threats, removals, or hostility.
- Publicly affirm all of the above by way of updating Reddit’s User Agreement and Reddit’s Moderator Code of Conduct to include reasonable expectations and requirements for administrators’ behavior. 
- Implement and fill a senior-level role (with decision-making and policy-shaping power) of ""Moderator Advocate"" at Reddit, with a required qualification for the position being robust experience as a volunteer Reddit moderator.

Reddit is unique amongst social-media sites in that its lifeblood – its multitude of moderators and contributors – consists entirely of volunteers. We populate and curate the platform’s many communities, thereby providing a welcoming and engaging environment for all of its visitors. We receive little in the way of thanks for these efforts, but we frequently endure abuse, threats, attacks, and exposure to truly reprehensible media. Historically, we have trusted that Reddit’s administrators have the best interests of the platform and its users (be they moderators, contributors, participants, or lurkers) at heart; that while Reddit may be a for-profit company, it nonetheless recognizes and appreciates the value that Redditors provide. 

That trust has been all but entirely eroded… but we hope that together, we can begin to rebuild it.

In simplest terms, Reddit, we implore you: **Remember the human**. 

We look forward to your response by Thursday, June 29th, 2023.

It\'s often the little things they do that brighten our days—whether it\'s the excited wag of their tails when we return home, their soft nuzzles when they sense we\'re feeling down, or simply the way they curl up next to us for warmth and comfort. These simple acts foster a deep emotional connection, making us feel valued and cared for. From a scientific perspective, dogs and humans share a unique bond that has evolved over thousands of years. Studies show that interacting with dogs can increase the release of oxytocin, often referred to as the ""love hormone,"" which is the same chemical that strengthens bonds between humans. This hormone is produced in both humans and dogs during moments of affection, solidifying the emotional connection between the two species. Furthermore, dogs are incredibly perceptive to human emotions and body language, often responding to our feelings with empathy and affection, which amplifies the sense of companionship. Their unconditional love and dependence on us also play a role in why we feel so protective and caring toward them, triggering our nurturing instincts. On the other hand, dogs love us not just for the food and shelter we provide, but for the attention and companionship we offer, which they thrive on. They are pack animals by nature, and in a human household, we become their pack, creating a bond that is both primal and deeply affectionate. Their loyalty and affection are a constant reminder of the simple, pure joys in life, making them one of the greatest sources of happiness for people around the world.']",176,https://v.redd.it/yi2xg9irlrnd1,https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/1fcmlmf/wireless_icecream_transfer/

Welllllll... it is honestly not likely. A cig burns anywhere from 720 to 750 degrees Fahrenheit. Gasoline has an auto-ignition temperature of 536°F. The flash point being -49 Degrees Fahrenheit. A lot of what you cannot factor with these numbers is that gasoline has a very specific air mixture and exposure to environment that also factors igniting the gasoline.\n\n\nTo put it simply. If you put gasoline in a jug with a small opening and tossed a lit cig in, would it ignite? probably...\n\nIf you poured gasoline, a small amount or wafted some around in a large open room and threw your cig butt at the gasoline would it ignite? Not great chances.\n\n\nThe tricky thing with gasoline is that there are a lot of random things that can happen to cause an ignition.

No. If your cigarette could reach the ignition temperature for gasoline then it would be hot enough to cause it to combust in to flames when you  drag on it. \n\nThis is some typical Reddit uninformed stuff that gets upvoted even though they're completely wrong.\n\nGo look up the gasoline ignition temp on Wiki. Now check the temp of your cigarette with a thermometer. It will be off by at least 100F"", 'Dude, Google it. The ignition temperature of gasoline vapor is way, way lower than the temperature of a cigarette while someone is puffing on it.\n\n\nLegit, just Google it. Then come back and apologize and we can both move on. (Google it anywhere, but roughly the temperature can get up to 900oC during a puff of a cigarette, which is four times higher than the ignition temperature of gasoline vapor...)\n\n', ""Or you know.. people that tested it..\n\nhttp://www.intuitor.com/moviephysics/\n\n>We knew that puffing a cigarette would increase the tip's temperature substantially and would help mix vapor and air together. We became convinced that puffing a cigarette over the gasoline would cause it to ignite. To test it, we built a simple smoking apparatus which could draw air through the cigarette or push it backwards out the tip.\n\n>We tested the apparatus repeatedly in both modes without getting ignition. During a test a cigarette was consumed rapidly and glowed brightly. Often sparks shot or fell off the cigarette. They were smoked at various levels above the gasoline to insure that at least part of the time they were in a region with an ignitable mixture. Surprisingly, even when a cigarette was puffed it didn't ignite the gasoline.\n\nLike I said initially, static is more dangerous lighting gasoline than a cigarette. The conditions required for a cigarette are pretty crazy. Static on the other hand is relatively easy.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6VKxmUPb3g\n\nedit; video of static ignition"", ""I am not debating whether or not static is more or less likely. I am pointing out that the tip of a burning cigarette is hot enough to ignite gasoline vapor. Which it is.\n\n\nAlso, this test is irrelevant. I am sure you could do it 10000 times and not cause an ignition, sure. The ash around the end of the cigarette acts as insulation to stop the vapor hitting the hottest part of the burning tip. But that is because it was a fixed apparatus which blew air both ways. When you're holding it in your hand you are waving it around, which causes the 'protective' layer of insulating ash to blow of, exposing hotter areas of the cigarette to the vapor.\n\n\n\nThis test was not accurate to real world conditions. And even still! even if it's a 1 in 10000000 chance. That's still too high to allow it. Yes, static can cause a fire too. So can a kid playing with matches. That's all irrelevant. Smoking a cigarette drastically increases the chance a cigarette will start a fire at a gas station (Technically it infinitely increases the chance, as the chance is 0 without it, but let's just say drastically) so let's not do it.\n\n\n\n\nI mean, the guy could burn his shirt with the cigarette, which would then spark hot enough to set fire to the place, depending on his clothing of choice. You seem to be advocating for allowing burning ash to be allowed while fuelling your car with highly flammable liquid. I am not sure why... unless you have a desire to prove people wrong as a way to assert your intellect, which, even though in this case you are wrong either way, is really just kinda sad, ya know?

So husband, baby brother, the dog and I gathered together in the living room where she announced, with a tone that was most serious, that she’s come to the conclusion that Squint (elf on the shelf), is not real and therefore she doesn’t think Santa is real, either.  She then proceeded to show us her notebook which contained notes of various experiments she had secretly conducted upon Squint.\n\nThe first experiment was to touch and move the elf, which kids are not supposed to do according to the book because it takes away the elf’s magic. She noted that Squint still moved that night.\n\nShe cuffed Squint’s hands and feet with pipe cleaners but noted he still moved that night. She told him to move to specific areas under the bribe that if he does, he will find treats. But he didn’t consistently move to those spots and has yet to find the treats, etc. \n\nThe night before the family meeting, the last experiment she did was to put scissors over Squint’s legs and close them ever so slightly to see how Squint would respond, stopping just short of actually cutting Squint’s legs. She said that any living thing would not have trusted her to stop and would have moved away or fought back and therefore, he’s not real.\n\nAdmittedly I was a bit disturbed, but we had a big talk away from her little brother and asked her to please not spoil the magic for him, which she promised not to do.', ""That's it.

Santa can check on all of them at the same time and see who\'s good and who\'s bad. He then keeps the list of which kid is which, but he does this by writing these lists very quickly. He cannot do this with the lists though. If he was able to really quickly write down the list of what you wanted, get the whole thing in a second for each kid, it would still take him 31 years for 1 billion good kids! So Santa doesn\'t really handle telling the elves what kids want, he can check and make sure they are doing the job correctly, but he doesn\'t tell them what it is what you want. It\'s many elves that read the letters and make sure you can get your gifts and make sure you\'re in the nice list. Now elves are magical, but not as magical as Santa, they do not know everything you do, instead they need to get your letter to know what you want and get to working. Kids who don\'t write the letter may still get a present, but Santa rushes writing down what they want so quickly, that the elves sometimes read it wrong and get you the wrong present. It\'s better to send your letter to make sure they can see it.\n\n(you can add this to the above: *""Even if Santa could write down the letters himself...""*)\nAn appeal to emotion.\n\nIt makes Santa really happy to receive the letters. Think about it you know your dad and mom love you. But it still makes you happy hearing that they love you, and getting hugs, and kisses and all that. Why would you need to get this if you already know they love you? Because it\'s nice to get something that shows what we know. Santa knows what you want, but he really enjoys receiving letters and reading them, he keeps his favorite and reads them throughout the year to make him happy knowing how such a good kid got such a good present. He makes you so happy with the presents already, why not make him happy by sending the old man a letter?\n\nAnd when they respond that their friends are into Santa, an appeal to fear:\n\nSanta doesn\'t visit kids who are too grown up to believe in him. So when other kids tell you that its their parents that put the gifts, it\'s probably true, they don\'t believe in Santa so its their parents that need to put the gifts under the tree. You know how capable we are of giving you gifts, we can\'t compete with Santa.. but if you don\'t believe already then I guess it\'s too late...\n\nSource: have tricked kids into believe I never slept and only occasionally ate a bit of chilli powder on the mornings.', 'Bravo', 'As someone who has had this monologue memorized since my freshman year of high school (circa 1998), I would just like to applaud OP for their attention to detail.

But that doesn't tell him anything about what we want for Christmas because what he sees is sleeping boys and girls...\n\nHe knows when we are awake. Again correct. But this too doesn't tell him anything about what we want for Christmas because all he knows from this is that we are awake.\n\nHe knows when you've been bad or good. Correct. But this too doesn't tell him anything about what we want for Christmas because this is just knowledge of if when we've been bad or good.\n\nEven if we accept that Santa sees everything we do (That was not the actual claim. He just knows if what we do is bad or good. But if we accept it as true) that still doesn't tell him ANYTHING about what you want for Christmas.\n\nSay for instance you want a Skateboard for Christmas. This is presumably because you do not have a Skateboard. Not having a skateboard Santa of course would never see you riding a skateboard and enjoying it (unless you borrowed a friends). Not having seen you enjoy skateboarding there is nothing to tell Santa you might want a Skateboard.\n\nSo clearly if you want to Santa to know what you want for Christmas, you have to do SOMETHING for him to know. The accepted standard of practice for that SOMETHING is to either write a letter and ask your parents to mail that to the North Pole, or go to the Mall and tell him what you want for Christmas.\n\nNow if you accept the argument that he knows everything you do, then of course you don't really have to mail the letter to the North Pole, because he would know what the letter says as soon as you write it... however he doesn't know everything you do. Just if what you do is bad or good.\n\nBy the way if you want something for Christmas it's polite (good) to ask for it, and not demand it. Demanding it would be bad. Thus writing a nice letter or going to see Santa at the mall while behaving is a simple way of earning a couple of extra good points.\n\nNow I know, many movies show Santa having a detailed list of things kids have done throughout the year (IE: Little Jimmy pulled little Suzy's hair.) and sometimes he uses magic (or tech or magical tech) to review what someone has done. In some movies he even can recall such details on a whim without having to consult a list but this last part is the most unbelievable because the song clearly says he makes a list and checks it twice. We know for a FACT that Santa keeps a list and has need to check it more than once for errors. So he knows he might make a mistake, and tries to make sure that doesn't happen. And that's another reason we write to Santa. It's harder to make mistakes if you have something in writing.\n\nThis is also why you should give the letter to Santa to your parents and not just try to mail it to the north pole yourself. Good Parents will proof read your letter to make sure that Santa won't have any confusion with the letter, and will make sure it's addressed properly.

I don't look at it like we're lying to the kids, it's more like just allowing them to have this small window before it's gone forever.

Reddit has no problem yelling at people for believing in God, but a fat German wizard? Sign us up!"", 'Santa: A Ridiculous Capitalist Myth\n\nIt amazes me that so many allegedly ""educated"" people have fallen so quickly and so hard for a fraudulent fabrication of such laughable proportions. The very idea that santa happens to come to our house, showing itself in neat, 1-year cycles -- with the same amount of presents all the time -- is ludicrous. Furthermore, it is an insult to common sense and a damnable affront to intellectual honesty and integrity. That people actually believe it is evidence that the capitalists have wrested the last vestiges of control of our public school system from decent, God-fearing Americans (as if any further evidence was needed! Daddy\'s Roommate? God Almighty!)\n\nDocumentaries such as Enemy of the State have accurately portrayed the elaborate, byzantine network of surveillance satellites that the capitalists have sent into space to spy on law-abiding Americans. Equipped with technology developed by Amazon Inc., these satellites have the ability to detect children from hundreds of kilometers up. That\'s right, neighbors .. the next time you\'re out in the backyard exercising your gift giving rights, the capitalists will see it! These satellites are sensitive enough to tell the difference between an Xbox and a ps4! And when they detect you with a gift, their computers cross-reference the address to figure out your name, and then an enormous database housed at Berkeley is updated with information about you.\n\nOf course, this all works fine during the day, but what about at night? Even the capitalists can\'t control the rotation of the Earth to prevent nightfall from setting in (only Joshua was able to ask for that particular favor!) That\'s where ""santas workshop"" comes in.

The ink is expensive as a way to make up for the cost of the hardware. Nearly all desktop inkjet printers are sold at or below cost (manufacturer, NOT reseller).\n\nWhy sell under cost? It's not just because everyone else is doing it. A lot of this comes from testing new technology. Epson, HP, Cannon, OKI and others all have commercial and industrial size printers that use the same technology. The consumer market is a great way to mass test new printheads, pumps, sensors, inks, firmware, software, etc. without the risk of losing major customers if a new printer technology fails. This is also a way to spend money internally (instead of being taxed) by one division buying up the losses of another division.\n\nYour black text is most likely a 4 color build because it looks nicer than the black ink can achieve on its own. This is also nearly impossible to override without advanced printing software. So when the printer said it needed cyan it really did, even if it is used sparingly. The printer also does not want to allow a printhead to be used without ink because it can introduce air bubbles into a liquid system and the pumps on the desktop printers may not be strong enough to pull them out."", ""- I only want to scan\n\n\n- Fuck you! Go and buy a new ink cartridge and unseal it when if you aren't really going to print for months."", ""Don't even get me started on Magenta"", 'So I wanted to throw it out there because everyone is hating on printers and the cost of ink (with partially good reason).\n\nFor starters, printer ink is expensive because of the extremely precise mechanical properties the ink need to have. Inkjet printers use extremely small needle like jets (yes *ink* *jets*) to spray tiny droplets of ink onto paper making the letters or image. They need ink that has just the right thermal/electrical/flow properties or the tiny droplets won’t flow right due to an incorrect viscosity or they could end up clogging the jets and really ruin image quality. Laser printers that use toner don’t use ink at all, the toner is actually tiny droplets of plastic that are melted onto the paper and the control/placement of the plastic needs to be just right for accurate images. Both toner and ink need to be able to dry quickly and be smear resistant which also further complicates their material property requirements.\n\nAdditionally people are pointing out how printers often cost less than the ink that is used in them. This is because of the marketing strategy used by printing companies: they often sell the printer at around or lower than the cost of manufacturing in order to stay competitive in the market, then try to make their profits in the back end because they know you need to buy ink/toner. This is why they force you to buy their products and make it hard to use replacements; because if you were able to use third party ink/toner then they wouldn’t be able to make their money back from manufacturing. It’s not a new marketing strategy, a lot of gaming consoles like the Xbox/PlayStation do the same, selling the console for about what it cost to make because they know you have to buy their products to use them.

Anybody could\'ve done it, including you or me. Zoom\'s setting are just unsecured by default which allowed anybody to join those rooms.\n\nAlso conflating ""we shouldn\'t use Zoom"" to ""teachers shouldn\'t use any online classroom"" is stupid. Believe it or not, there are alternatives to Zoom; Zoom is not the only way to hold an online class.  That\'s why Taiwan and Canada banned the use of Zoom in schools on a country-wide level. That\'s also why many schoolboards banned the use of Zoom. That\'s also why many companies have banned the use of zooms privately as well on employee devices.\n\nI don\'t know if you\'re genuinely ignorant, or if you\'re shilling for Zoom, but ""don\'t use zoom"" doesn\'t mean ""don\'t use any online classroom at all"".', 'i dont know if youre just ignorant or if youre purposely misinterpreting what im saying.

This guy isn\'t like ""i dont care about creeps showing genitals to kids."" hes probably either unaware, or is going by his own schools policy. Get over yourself. Tons of people misuse things all the time. These are rare isolated incidents. Again, you could use this logic about anything you want. The internet in general is not secure.', 'You don\'t get to pull the ""ignorant"" argument after demonstrating your own immense ignorance on the topic by saying:\n\n1. ""Obviously people can hack programs dude"" when it had nothing to do with hackers, and\n\n2. ""The idea that no teacher should try to continue educational ventures with online classrooms because..."" when nobody at all said ""no teacher should try to continue educational ventures with online classrooms"".\n\nHow on earth did I misinterpret what you\'re saying? What you said was in plain text, don\'t pretend I misinterpreted anything if you can\'t point out specifically what I misinterpreted.\n\nTo downplay the issues with Zoom as ""a few isolated incidents"" is beyond ridiculous. The FBI doesn\'t issue warnings about a program because of ""a few isolated incidents"". The issue with Zoom isn\'t an issue of ""bad people exist"". The issue is that Zoom itself has time and time again created problems of their own that people can exploit. You\'re literally downplaying the issue as if Zoom isn\'t responsible, when Zoom has literally created issues that other online meeting platforms don\'t have. Microsoft Teams didn\'t redirect all your data to China, which Zoom did. Other platforms don\'t allow completely random strangers to randomly connect to your private board meeting, or into your classroom lecture, etc. You\'re literally downplaying issues Zoom has caused and attributing it to ""hackers"" when hackers have nothing to do with it. Like I said, you\'re obviously ignorant, or shilling for Zoom. As you said, get over yourself, you don\'t know better than literal governments, the district of new york, google, nasa, etc who\'ve all banned the use of Zoom specifically for various reasons.\n\nIn addition, you make a claim that i\'m misinterpreting what you\'re saying (without pointing out where and how I did so), but then go on to assume I\'m criticizing the teacher by saying ""This guy isn\'t like ""i dont care about creeps showing genitals to kids."". Nowhere do I criticize the teacher, of course it\'s not his choice as to what\'s being used. But the schoolboard should know better.\n\nAdditionally, the conference bombing wasn\'t an ""isolated incident"", it was literally widespread because Zoom made all chat rooms public and unprotected by default, which was why it blew up in the news. Does this happen to other platforms? Yes, but on a much smaller scale.\n\nThe internet is not secure, but that\'s why it\'s up to companies to implement security onto their software. They make use of things like TLS, the security of ""the internet in general"" is irrelevant when we\'re talking about application level software. The internet not being secure is even more reason why Zoom itself should\'ve taken security more seriously, instead of LITERALLY routing data to China.', ""The school board using Zoom isn't an issue if you're OK with people disrupting the classroom with lewd stuff. It isn't about what is being taught officially being an issue."", 'So are you gonna stop driving cars? Cuz you know those things crash right?
