2,new,gaming,The survival mode in the original modern warfare 3 makes no sense.,The reason why it doesn't make sense id because the overlord can communicate with you which if you are really stranded then he shouldn't be able to contact you. You can also call for backup from one of the cabinets on the map and they can send a helicopter with troops to help you but they can't send a helicopter to pick you up. When you die the overlord gives you a rating and he either say good job or you can do better. The only way the survival mode would make sense is if it was in a simulation like in Halo's multiplayer.,2024-09-10 15:41:56,Fancy-Advice-2793,0,False,"['Finally, someone has found a plot hole in the normally airtight plots of the Call of Duty series.

IMO it's better then zombies."", ""I get what you're saying - The survival mode in Modern Warfare 3 has several significant inconsistencies. Firstly, the core concept of the mode assumes that players are completely isolated and stranded. However, the fact that the Overlord can constantly communicate with you is quite confusing. If you’re truly cut off and unable to call for help, it doesn’t make sense for someone to be able to communicate with you.\n\nAdditionally, you can call for backup from cabinets scattered around the map, and a helicopter with troops will come to assist you. However, this helicopter doesn’t come to pick you up. This creates a major inconsistency, as it seems strange that a unit capable of sending assistance cannot perform the basic function of picking you up.\n\nWhen you die, the Overlord gives you a rating and comments on your performance, either saying “good job” or “you could do better.” This feedback seems out of place given the context of being in a life-or-death situation and completely isolated.\n\nGiven these issues, the survival mode would make much more sense if it were set in a simulation environment. A simulation framework, like the one in Halo’s multiplayer, would provide a more coherent explanation for these anomalies. For instance, if the mode were described as a type of training simulation or test environment, the Overlord’s ability to communicate and the responses to help calls would fit better within that context. This would make the experience more consistent and believable for the player."", 'Hot take: That survival mode beats out any zombies content CoD has ever put out.', 'idk if you know but zombies mode in all the other CODs also makes no sense. zombies arent real']",9,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1fdesg6/the_survival_mode_in_the_original_modern_warfare/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1fdesg6/the_survival_mode_in_the_original_modern_warfare/

5,new,gaming,Do you think video games can be spiritual?,"For anyone spiritual out there, we are aware that all things in life are interconnected by a common essence.

Video games are no exception.

It may sound silly that video games can be spiritual, but why would they be any different from anything else? The truth is they aren't.

Even games like Diablo and Assassin's Creed, to name two examples, are based on legit esotericism.

When it's all on song that to me is your spirituality.\n\nBut I think it's quite right to say that video games explore spiritual things. Computer graphics is a ripe medium to explore the ephemeral. It's completely imaginative.\n\nMystical realms are regularly explored through video games - the idea of ghosts, spirits, spells, hidden powers and so forth. It does so in quite a mature way often, too - I think of Elden Ring and the way a lot is unsaid, but yet it doesn't shy away from exploring these occult concepts, primarily through images.\n\nSometimes, if 'spirituality' is too overt and forced, people can turn away from it. So I think an ambiguous and subtle tone regarding esoteric matters can be a sensible approach.\n\nWe know in cinema sound and moving pictures combine to create moments of euphoria, and looking ahead even to VR, I can't see why those techniques and themes can't continue to evolve through the medium of realtime CGI ."", 'After playing ""GRIS"" I felt kinda refreshing or like free from some burden.', ""RELIGION is a scam, invented by ancient shamans to exert control over gullible masses.\n\nI understand it brings you a ton of calmness, thinking that when that bus hits you because you didn't look both ways, there will be some paradise waiting for you where you will live forever.

It probably should have gotten a sequel but it didn\'t. That happens a lot.\n\nI understand why the game director is upset about this and how it affected his career, but these are issues he should talk about with a therapist or close friends and family, not in public. The public, by and large, doesn\'t care about Days Gone. Deek showing up in Astro Bot was a nice little nod to the character. It\'s about the same amount of attention as Crash Bandicoot got, and that character was absolutely foundational to PlayStation. It\'s not an insult or slight in any way.

Most open-world games start out somewhat bare bones with their first entry anyway. This franchise had a ton of potential for a sequel. New location/environment. Better story.

In this art, its moulded with ornate patterns. I'm aware the marines portrayed there are likely veterans, but this is something you see in a very high proportion of good 40K art.

One of her favorite games is Super Mario Bros.\n\nA few years ago, my ex girlfriend brought her Wii over, and I thought my mom would get a kick out of the Mario Wii game. I forget the title. The 2D side scrolling one.\n\nIt was then that I learned that SOMEHOW, after all these years, she couldn't run and jump at the same time. She's incapable of holding B and pressing A to jump. How the hell did she ever play!?"", 'BOOOOOOOOY', 'This is touching to me. Being a dad and teaching my 6 year old how to play Zelda and watch him tackle challenges on his own is probably the coolest thing about having kids.', 'Story time.\n\nI was very good at halo going into uni. I was the best on campus, and no one else was very close for the first year or two I was there.  At the start, people would just come in and watch me play MLG matchmaking or customs with my other good friends.  Many of them wanted a shot, so we would play 2s-4s on matchmaking, and I would let them ruin my rank, so I could build it back up for them to ruin again.  Eventually, there was enough interest that we had 8 guys who wanted to play.  \n\nWe had enough interest, so we played LANs. We would set up two CRT tv\'s in different two rooms and connect them with an Ethernet cable through the hallway.  At the start we would have to scrap to get 8 people to play, pounding on doors and pulling guys from their girlfriends.  Sometimes we played 2v2s or 3v3s, but NEVER anything but true MLG rules.  \n\nMy team would literally never lose if I was playing full on, so I played lazy most of the time so it kept the games fairer.  I would give up snipes/shotty/rockets everytime to let everyone else practice.  I would even pretend to have homework, pass the controller, and coach one team while I ""wrote a paper.""  \n\nThese were my boys.  After a few months, my boys got very, very good.\n\nBy the end of our freshman year, we had 10-12 guys every night playing competitive games.  We would play in my dorm from after dinner til one or two am.  There was ALWAYS someone in my room, on my xbox, even if we weren\'t LANing.  We even had four upper classmen who were on sports teams (they lived in different dorms) challenge our best four.  Then I played full on. There were around ten guys watching these games, and I got a few killtacs.  One memorable killtac was on Ascension and it was a full chamber, four headshot sniper killtac.  The room exploded and kids ran from my room to the other room just to trashtalk in the middle of the game.  They lost around 10 in a row before they left without saying good game. The upper classmen wouldn\'t let me play against them anymore, but they loved having me over to carry them in BTB or whatever shit they played. \n\nSophomore year started and a new batch of freshman came in.  This added six more guys.    An upperclassman transfer heard about us, so he joined.  He was as good as I was, so we were always team captains to keep games balanced (he might have been a bit better than I was, but I would never tell him that.  He was the pointguard for our school\'s basketball team and absurdly cocky at the time. We would later become roommates and he was in my wedding).  At this point, we had far too many people and we had to figure out ways to get everyone a chance.  Bottom two +/- players from each team passed the controller.  At around this time, I no longer had to play lazy, and some of my friends that were shit at the start were outperforming me.  It got to the point where we had 6-8 guys who were close to the same skill level.  We could make very competitive teams, and my Junior year, it had gotten very competitive.  We would have halo drama complete with fights and shit. That was good fun too, because then I could take the training wheels off and talk trash a bit too. \n\nWe ended up sending a team of four to MLG Columbus in the early 00\'s.  We did not do great (shocker, I was a big fish in a little pond), but we played very respectably during scrims with other teams our level.  It was an amazing experience that I wouldn\'t trade for the world.  These guys are now my forever friends, and, in retrospect, I laugh at people who told me I would regret playing video games so much in uni.', ""It's always heartwarming when I see my friends playing a game I showed them years ago, and they share it with someone else for the first time."", 'This is how BOTW started with my youngest and I.

They very often have this outlook that the men saying these stuff are toxic or manipulative, and the girls are victims of this approach. What I often see is that these men have very little social skills. They try their best to get in touch with these girls, whom they view as strong, desirable and competent, in a way that they think is good. \n\nSome of them have really learnt that Mario(no joke) and Link are good role models. Not because they are depictions of how men actually behave, but because a lot of these boys and men have lacked a proper positive masculine role model in their real life. They use what they know. A man or boy being overly chivalrous, to a point where it’s weird even, is probably doing so because he has a very positive view of the girl he is talking to. And in his mind being kind and a good man(hero) for this girl means being chivalrous, coming to her aid, like Mario or Link(especially link is a very relatable character as he is brave, handsome and strong). To me this is nothing to make fun of. It’s rather very sad to see these boys and men try their best to reach out to someone they view as highly positive, and are left being made fun of and misunderstood. \n\nAnd make no mistake about it - you girls are viewed as positive! Some of these men might be weird, make you feel uncomfortable, some even toxic making gestures or approaches that is highly inappropriate. Being a girl meeting these men(online) is often difficult and very taxing because the men are lacking social skills that creates a good atmosphere. Since it’s the girls who know better in that situation they are the ones that finds it most uncomfortable. But, almost all the time their approaches and behaviour stems from them viewing you as positive. Not just attractive, but positive. Girls are viewed as kinder, emotionally smarter, easier to talk to, safer. A girl is a good friend too, and a lot of these men are missing that. Like they are sitting alone in the sandbox in kindergarten. And when they are weird, they are trying their best. When they ask if you have a boyfriend it’s their best attempt to find out if they can move closer or not. If they are toxic it’s because they often are angry that they are missing the positives a girl represents in their own life. Girls are in this story so much stronger than these men. \n\nIt is these men’s responsibility to mature and learn other ways to talk to girls, especially online. But it is so important to understand where these boys and men are coming from, to see the value they put on to you women. It is a sadness to see posts like this, because it makes it clear how these men are perceived. Them reaching out and doing their best comes across as weird and toxic. Imagine how much they struggle to get in touch with people, girls in particular. Imagine how lonely they are. \n\nIn my experience knowing where a behaviour comes from makes handling the impact of that behaviour a lot easier. Understand that a toxic man is being so because he finds what a woman represents unattainable. It’s a positive excluded from him.

Some women have shown a strong interest, (not as often, Ill give ya that lol), but most if not all, showed their attention and affection while in a relationship. I think that points more towards my decision-making, meaning I generally will not try and pursue a relationship with someone who is not giving me attention. That, I think, is where these 'lonely, attention-starved' men you speak of get it wrong. Not getting attention from someone purely because of their gender is ridiculous.

Either way, these are your own personal hang-ups and prejudices. \n\n>And honestly men like you drive the women away or force them to not use mics\n\nThere it is again, that gaslighting bully fallacy. Women are not driven away from gaming, but they do come into gaming with a lot of pre-existing prejudices. You are just using whatever excuses you can find to justify your own misandry, toxic behaviour and attacks. Vilifying men you resent for existing is a very easy way to do this.\n\nThe fact is, most women do not like gaming and men who game(typically a hobby that is viewed as unmasculine, uncool or counter-productive to men\'s traditional gender roles of provider/protector). Your own negative attitude towards male gamers is driving you away from using mics in games. Not men. The excuses you come up with after the fact don\'t really match the reality of the situation. \n\n>That\'s half the reason it\'s such a boy\'s club in the first place, you scare more femme noobs away with your toxic bs.\n\nRight, because I am addressing your prejudices, which are pre-existing, I am being toxic. And, no, women are not being scared off by men who are, in all reality, incredibly supportive and welcoming to women. You are literally attacking men right now for being attracted to female gamers and trying to engage them.\n\n Most women are already taught to have a negative attitude towards gaming, and men in gaming, before they even pick up a controller. This is why men are usually excited or surprised when they meet women who aren\'t, and why women look for every reason not game(and then blame the men they are already taught to hate for it).

The other thing to know, which properly frames the situation, is that the power distribution for a track like this is flawed. When you squeeze the trigger for both controllers, and there are two cars on the track, the power is distributed pretty evenly, but if one of the cars is knocked off the track or your opponent releases their trigger to break suddenly, then that power is instantaneously transferred to the other car and car number 2 sees a comparable boost in acceleration and velocity for the exact same applied trigger pressure.\n\nWhen I went to college I studied Electrical Engineering, and it makes sense as both tracks are wired in parallel, but at the time, it was just known as the method to knock your opponent from the track. Both racers accelerate so they are going as fast as they can without getting thrown from the track, then just before your opponent enters a turn, you drop your throttle and watch as your opponent now finds themselves accelerating into a turn.\n\nFor the rest of the evening my Father tried in vain to knock me from the track.

27,top,gaming,Can we please boycott Star Wars battlefront 2,"I bought EA Star Wars Battlefront as a fan of Star Wars and felt ripped off. Played the beta of Star Wars battlefront 2 and you still can't just get in a vehicle, it feels so fake. Why is Rey in the clone wars!? That is all bad, but EA have just totally taken the piss with abusing Star Wars fans and cutting their games into little pieces and bleeding the fan base dry. 

I've had enough.

Edit 1: Spelt Rey wrong sorry! Autocorrect and I didn't check.

Edit 2: Thank you so very much for the support that this post has received, it really has been quite overwhelming. This post is very much a quick outpouring of thoughts of mine rather then a well thought through argument focusing on the main issues with EA's Star Wars Battlefront 2. I only eluded to the main issues, rather than outright stating the unacceptable issues with loot boxes, progression grind, the pay to win aspects and the short campaign etc. However people who are on this sub reddit are very much aware of the main issues.

All I hope that this post has managed to bring attention to the main issues and bring about some positive change.  

Edit 3: Thank you kind strangers for the reddit gold!

What really needs to happen is for E3 to roll around. Let all the video game and console devs do their presentation. Then; when EA steps out, and only when EA steps out, people collectively \'boo\' and turn their backs throughout the whole presentation. The only thing gamers can do short of buying absolutely 0 EA games (unlikely) which would tank stocks, is to show them their actions have reached a pinnical of disappointment for their consumers.

I always assumed ""RIP inbox"" was a joke.\n\nEdit #2: Ok so since this is still a comment people are latching onto and I have access to my computer now, I guess I should make as few things a little clearer. I know it\'s all paid-to-clap press. Those people are paid to write \'best in E3 show!\' \'Battlefront 2 made me cry!\' \'#newEAgamelooksdope\' bias is part of their resume. \'Yes man\' their label. My point is that it would have to get to that moment where even the paid to gold seal \'reporters\' have had enough. Sadly, there will never be a universal ban on one publisher. For those who\'ve been in a guild, it\'s common knowledge gamers rarely will work together for the better of the whole without having their ego stroked as the one. I would assume this applies double for trying to ban a publisher. At this point, all you can do is the single most damaging thing to a major corporation; and that is to tank their stocks. Their PR will kiss shit stained player ass and do it with a smile. That\'s their job. What we need to start thinking as a whole collective is how to make their stock holders and CEO\'s start applying rose red lipstick and considering their go-to tongue action move. This means, actively boycotting all their products. Which nobody will do. I\'m favor of a comment I saw where someone suggested, as far as Battlefront II was concerned, attack Disney.

Disney stopped selling magic and childhood dreams mid-80\'s. What the fuck do they know about fun and happiness (anybody who points to their theme parks have clearly never stood 4-hours in line for a five minute ride)? That does mean however, we need to stop the cycle of being the industries bitches. Take some fucking responsibility. In many ways; these practices became practical to them because gamers (us) showed them that it was a viable business model. Like paying for a gold subscription on Xbox. DLC that is a few skin changes for guns or characters. Sloppy/shoddy/irrelevant pre-order bonuses. Games that were released buggy because a deadline had to be met (yet are rarely fixed once the cash in comes) If we as gamers want a more responsible publisher and game dev; we must become more responsible consumers of games.

EA Games is quickly driving the Star Wars intellectual property off a high cliff with their shady business practices. Specifically, the Battlefront II game will feature a pay-to-win gambling system designed to present players with a choice after their initial purchase of $60-$100: Spend unreasonable amounts of time to unlock content within the game or spend additional cash for a random chance to unlock this same content.\n\nThis business model is prevalent in portable gaming where the price for entry into the game is significantly lower. It seems like a blatant cash grab in a premium title for home consoles. There\'s already been a backlash of millions of gamers against the game on the popular web community, Reddit.com. EA has garnered the dubious title of having the ""most downvoted comment in history"" for their response to a fan inquiry about the fairness of these micro-transactions.\n\nYou can view that exchange here: https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsBattlefront/comments/7cff0b/seriously_i_paid_80_to_have_vader_locked/dppum98/\n\nThe first Battlefront game has been widely panned by gamers and this latest sequel seems to cast an even darker shadow across an otherwise beloved franchise.

Why aren’t you complaining that you can’t access all the quests at once or unlock all the perks and weapons from level 1? “But it’s a different game!!!!” And? The concept is the same, why aren’t you bitching that you don’t have time to play the hundreds of hours you’d need to complete TW3 100%?\n\nLoot boxes suck, I’ll agree with everyone there.\n\nBut the complaints about the game beyond that are amusing. They say they don’t want this progression unlock and such, they just want Pandemic’s BF2 back.\n\nWell EA’s BF1 was pretty similar, it lacked maps, but beyond that it was more or less the battlefront of old. But people lambasted it for having a season pass and lacking maps, and getting old very fast! \n\nWell guess what? EA did away with the season pass and replaced it with loot boxes. Is that good? Hell no. But you can’t exactly blame them for not going the whole DLC route when last game people lampooned them for it.\n\nAnd BF2 of yore also got old fast, the reason you think it didn’t is because of your own rose tinted goggles. We could play the same repetitive game for hours when we were young, but now that we’re old and used to modern games, not having progression or unlocks makes a game get old quite quickly. There’s no reason to pick up and play it again once you’ve gotten over the initial new factor. \n\nSo here we are. EA’s BF1 being a fairly faithful recreation of the original, just lacking content, and with a “full” (by FPS standards) DLC system. And? People didn’t like it. In fact they disliked it so much that on PC the playercount is *lower* than Pandemics 12 year old BF2.\n\nEA fucked up BF2 no doubt, but this reaction is asinine. But I’m not even talking about how stupid this is, just how everything people are saying they wanted was more or less in BF1 but disliked. \n\nBut yeah this whole knee jerking is stupid. But I’ll stop before I get downvoted to -100 again and the mods remove my comment because “games are serious business!!” \n\nEdit: don’t get me wrong, I’m not saying EA is doing right. They’re not. And of course an RPG is different to a shooter, but that doesn’t change the colossal time invested needed for most of them.

You, as the gamer, don\'t get to determine what the ""Full Game"" is. Just because there is DLC doesn\'t mean that should be included in the base game for $60. I played a $20 game called Little Nightmares. Fun little game, few hours of levels. I enjoyed it. They have a new level for $4 or a bundle with even more levels for $10. I don\'t expect to get those things for free. It\'s an expansion to the base game, and it costs money.\n\nNow, you may feel like a game doesn\'t have enough content for $60 and the DLC should be included. But you have no right to expect that. The only thing you can do is buy or not buy a game. Your opinion is not fact in determining how much a game should cost.\n\nYou have to look at the game and decide if you want it and would enjoy it. I don\'t go see Guardians of the Galaxy in the theaters and then complain that they are making a second one and charging me more money for it and that they should have been in the same movie. It\'s an additional story. It doesn\'t just come for free. That would be entitlement.\n\nYou are acting entitled to think that this video game should offer EVERYTHING you want for $60 and anything extra should be free and everything should be unlocked so you can use it now and they shouldn\'t be allowed to have ANY form of additional revenue from this game.\n\nDo you know what that would do to the gaming industry? It would kill it. Developers aren\'t going to spend years making games to not profit off of them. Publishers aren\'t going to put hundreds of millions in making and marketing a game if they can only sell it for $60 and have no other revenue streams from it.\n\nBF2 is offering a year of free updates with new maps, new characters, new weapons, new gear, new story missions, new events, and more. Absolutely everything in this game you can unlock for free without paying a dime over $60. Some people will choose to pay extra money to unlock some things earlier than others. Will it give them an advantage in multiplayer? Possibly. The issue ISN\'T about paying to unlock items in a game. The issue is about how big of an advantage people who pay will have over those who don\'t.\n\nIn my experience, I\'ve played with 0 star cards active and consistently place in the top third of the team. I don\'t think star cards are giving people a huge advantage. It\'s also only in early trial. People acting like others have an advantage could just be poor at the game. Just because someone killed you and had a star card active doesn\'t mean you would have killed this if they didn\'t have that star card. And they could have earned the star card and not paid for it. It\'s just all too subjective to form some kind of ""boycott"" around.

I\'m not going to buy loot boxes with real money, and I\'ll still have a good time.\n\nDo you not realize how you are being just as greedy as you claim EA is being? You want things for free and you want everything unlocked right away. You want to take away any and all progression in the game because that\'s what YOU want. You don\'t want them to have any means of making revenue from this game outside of the initial purchase price because you are too cheap to pay more for video games. It\'s like the people who complain that Netflix is raising their prices, but is just mooching off their parents account. If you aren\'t willing to pay the price of the content, then your opinion doesn\'t\' really matter. You don\'t just get what you want for free because you want it.', '> So now you want the game to be cheaper or free?\n\nI want them to do anything but this shitty business model. If game development costs are so expensive, they should either increase the upfront price and be honest about it, instead of piecemeal nickel and diming us for characters in a game, or they should lower development costs to sit within the $60 range.\n\n>This is the problem. You, as the gamer, don\'t get to determine what the ""Full Game"" is. Just because there is DLC doesn\'t mean that should be included in the base game for $60.\n\nDoes it make sense that you can buy Luke and Vader, two core characters of the SW franchise? Nevertheless, I can agree to an extent that it\'s murky at times what can be counted as the \'full game\' and extra. I DO have a problem when it\'s very obviously parts of what was developed, chopped off and sold after the fact for more money. Imagine if Smash 4 gated Luigi behind 40 hours of gameplay or you could pay $5.99 to unlock him right away. That\'s obviously bullshit.\n\n>Now, you may feel like a game doesn\'t have enough content for $60 and the DLC should be included. But you have no right to expect that. The only thing you can do is buy or not buy a game. Your opinion is not fact in determining how much a game should cost.\n\nOf course I have a right, I\'m a consumer, and if they want to keep selling games they should listen to their consumers. We had fully functional games just 10 years prior without any of this crap. The problem with this business model is it\'s ruining the base game for it\'s own sake. It\'s exploitation for the sake of money. You\'re paying for characters that ARE in the base game that are gated behind a ludicrously long grind time. Older games didn\'t DO unlocks like that AT ALL. You had to clear the games with certain characters or in a certain amount of time or complete challenges. That\'s actually ENGAGING. This isn\'t.\n\n>You have to look at the game and decide if you want it and would enjoy it.

For one, movies are not the same as games, and two, you\'re talking about a sequel. Of course they have the right to charge for the sequel. \n\nA better analogy would be if they released the movie on DVD and all of the scenes showing Rocket Raccoon were cut out, but you either have to watch the movie 10 times or pay for the extra special edition to see them.\n\n>You are acting entitled to think that this video game should offer EVERYTHING you want for $60 and anything extra should be free and everything should be unlocked so you can use it now and they shouldn\'t be allowed to have ANY form of additional revenue from this game.\n\nNo, I just think microtransactions are a fucking stupid business model and locking things behind a grind to coerce payment for them is exploiting consumers. They know damn well whales will pony up. \n\nI don\'t think DLC in of itself is a bad idea if it\'s done correctly. You know what actually used to be REALLY good? Expansion Packs. That was \'DLC\' before DLC and it was often fully featured story content, characters, game modes, etc. Something I would gladly pay $29.99 for or so, because it\'s not compromising the base game or the base experience.\n\n>Do you know what that would do to the gaming industry? It would kill it. Developers aren\'t going to spend years making games to not profit off of them. Publishers aren\'t going to put hundreds of millions in making and marketing a game if they can only sell it for $60 and have no other revenue streams from it.\n\nCry me a river.

The issue is about how big of an advantage people who pay will have over those who don\'t.**\n\nThis is a very poor argument. It IS about paying to unlock items. It\'s about how they purposefully -designed- the free unlocking method to make more money and compromised the progression. It\'s not fun or engaging at all. \n\nI\'m not a massive fan of DLC, but I would rather pay for those things you mentioned as an expansion than have it nickel and dime\'d from people and having my progression turned into a grindfest.\n\nAs I mentioned before, take Super Smash Bros. You could unlock things in a reasonable time, through various creative challenges, like \'beat the game with only 3 lives and no continues\', or \'clear all the bonus stages\'. You know why that\'s NOT in BFII? Because if you could unlock them in interesting ways without a grind, nobody would pay for the microtransactions! There is no value in the way you unlock things here, you are literally paying money in place of TIME. Is the core game experience probably otherwise fun to play? Sure, I don\'t think many people are disputing that. But you have to play it for countless HOURS to get things that are already in the game, grinding to get the character you want if you don\'t want to pay money. I would argue this method of unlocking characters is strictly inferior to the \'SSB\' model.\n\n>You obviously are free to do whatever you want, but don\'t expect everyone else to agree with your opinion.

It\'s not a market full of rubes getting suckered by EA - it\'s a market full of people buying games for all sorts of reasons, with all sorts of interests and play-styles. As you mentioned, prices have been stable for nearly 30 years. I remember begging my mom for Double Dragon for the NES back in 1987. $50 at the time. $110+ in today\'s money. For fucking Double Dragon. Now we get games with great replay value and in some cases hundreds of hours of content for $60, and then when the DLC isn\'t offered for free people go absolutely batshit. All these shouts of ""EA IS FUCKING US OVER!"" and ""NO OTHER INDUSTRY DOES THIS!""...bless your hearts. Much to learn there is, young padawans. People\'s lives aren\'t at stake here - it\'s a goddam video game. It\'s entertainment, and considering the ROI, relatively cheap entertainment at that. There are countless things more worthy of this level of righteous anger. Astounding that people can look at the work of hundreds of developers, artists, renderers, designers, etc. and, before even laying hands on the game, angrily call it complete shit and demand a boycott because there\'s, I dunno, loot crates. The entitlement is strong with this one.', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHSso2vufPM\nGames HAVE NOT been the same price for 20 years.', 'Thanks for sharing the link - but the point that the video is making isn\'t in conflict with the point I\'m trying to make. He uses Battlefront as an example. He\'s trying to make the point that $60 doesn\'t get you the full game. $60 for the core game and then $50 for the DLC. That\'s $110 dollars. In 1987, an NES game was ~$50. Adjusted for inflation, that\'s $110 in today\'s dollars. So, $110 for Double Dragon, $110 for Battlefront and all its content. Now, consider that you don\'t *have* to buy the DLC. The fact of the matter is it\'s cheaper today to be a gamer than it was in my youth, especially when you consider the pre-owned market, something that didn\'t exist in gaming\'s nascent years. I know I sound old-man ""I had to walk uphill in the snow to school, both ways"" about it, but facts is facts. It\'s not as though companies are saying it\'s $60 for the core game, and then for an additional $50 we\'ll let you install it. Opinions differ on the first Battlefront, but for a casual gamer such as myself $60 got me a gorgeous, simplistic, and mindless shooter that I could sit in front of for an hour or two here and there and blow shit up, all for less than the cost of shitty lasagna with the fam at the Olive Garden. Lots of people hated the game. They\'re probably a lot better at shooting people with imaginary lasers than I am. As for this release, I\'d rather see people trashing it on its merits rather than trashing it because EA, a company that employs people in a challenging industry, is trying to turn a profit. This probably sounds like I\'m defending EA. I\'m not. Corporations fucking suck in too many ways to count. But I don\'t begrudge them their prerogative to make choices that they believe will lead to success in their industry. As people have said - as consumers we have purchasing power, and the best way to effect change is with your wallet. If you don\'t like what they\'re doing, don\'t buy the game. More power to that. I just don\'t see this economic model as the egregious unethical cash-grab it\'s being made out to be. Lots of people saying \'make the games $100 and include all the content\'. Maybe that\'s the way to go? Time will tell.  ', ""Here's the thing about back then versus now, back then games didn't sell nearly the amount of copies that they do now, battlefront 2015 sold over 14 million copies before the end of that march, even assuming that EA makes only half the amount that the game sells for on each sale, that's 420 million dollars, on a game that probably costed about 50 million to make. These companies aren't struggling to make a profit on the initial sales of a 60$ game, there's no reason why we need a price increase just because of inflation because increase in sales more than took care of that problem."", ""Eh, not really. I think we can agree that Battlefront is an A-list title - one of the highest selling games on modern platforms. A 'good' title on the NES, for instance, might sell 2-3 million copies. Adjust that for inflation and you're looking at earnings around $300 million. Some titles, like the Super Mario series, Zelda, etc. sold much more. Consider too that these games were being made with far smaller budgets, and smaller development teams. These guys were maximizing profit, too - they're driven by $, not some mythical good-guy ethos. The time and complexity involved in creating today's big-name titles results in budgets that exceed hundreds of millions of dollars. Battlefront was almost certainly more expensive to develop than the 50 million figure you mention. No one is saying that EA is 'struggling' to make a profit, but the industry is notoriously volatile, and EA has figured out that DLC etc. is a model that is working - like it or not people are paying the cash to get loot, upgrades, maps, etc. This may seem like an evil scheme to some, to others it's just adapting to changes across the industry. I think that they've kept the core game at an affordable price point, and while I've yet to play it it doesn't seem to be lacking for content (single-player campaign, multiplayer, etc), and for people that want to spend the extra cash they can get the extra stuff. Indie studios and small developers exist in many cases to make art. Big publicly traded studios like EA exist to make money, and people expecting them to play by any other set of rules will end up disappointed.

I'm more than happy to expend energy combatting unethical business practices (think, BigPharma, BigAg, Wells Fargo, the mortgage crisis, etc), but...this? DLC is as bad as...child trafficking? Hyperbole much? This is entertainment, not life-saving-drugs. This isn't Martin Shkreli increasing the price of critical pharmaceuticals by 1000%. What is EA guilty of? In this case, it's giving the player two options: they can buy credits to unlock shit, or they can grind it out for the credits. Is that being a dick? Seems like most people think so - I'm not among them. Maybe sales #s will suck for BF2 and EA and others will say 'welp, microtransactions are dead' - if so, cool. But at the end of the day, they have a responsibility to their employees, and to their shareholders, to be successful - and they're gonna find a way. Maybe it's less content, maybe it's smaller games/titles, maybe it's $100 price points. I think it's important we don't conflate a lack of altruism on the part of a company like EA with a lack of ethics. I'll circle back around to the relative cost of gaming -- even with all this DLC/microtransaction circle jerk stuff, gaming is more affordable than it's ever been; it is a relatively inexpensive form of entertainment, and I sometimes think the sheer volume of platforms and titles out there has dulled us a little to just how amazing these virtual worlds that we get to play in are - and the work/cost on the part of developers and their teams to create them.

Now let's aim low and say EA makes 30$ on every game purchase, it's probably more like 50$ but hey let's give them the benefit of the doubt. Do the math and that's 420 million dollars. So now I ask, did Titanfall 2 need dlc and microtransactions to be a success? No. Did splatoon with it's relatively measly under 5 million sales have dlc and microtransactions? No. So no companies ARE making their money back on 60$ sales of games, they're making that and lots more. EA's CEO is not counting his pennies to see if he can afford the next meal for his family.

Sure, plenty of people skip the campaign modes in Call of Duty or Battlefield, which are video game franchises, and I’m included in that. But for the first Battlefront to be so limited as to not have the option when there were countless directions and decades of Star Wars history/movies for it to have gone and be modeled after, it was a easy deterrent to wasting my money.\n\nWhen it comes to Battlefront 2, no amount of beautiful trailers or HD laser beams and particle effects will get me to spend a week’s pay (I’m a college student and work part-time, okay) on a game that I won’t be able to enjoy until a month or two down the road when I get a hero or two.

Instead of giving heroes out to the best or a random player and allowing everyone to use vehicles, it actually tests everyone's skill and puts use to the little points you get for doing things in the match rather than just having a good score to be the best on the team. Not to mention, it allows vehicles to be accessed quite easily if you just play for a bit and then buy a vehicle with points you earn for actually playing the game instead of just being given a vehicle.

I was very late to the game, just getting a PS4 last Christmas (2016), and I was pretty ignorant about the bad reviews around BF1.  I was just a huge SW fan wanting to play the single player mode that BF1 surely must have.  I didn't care about the online multiplayer as online shooters are only fun for me when playing with friends (and even then can be more frustrating than fun.)  I admit I am not in EA's target demographic as a 41 year-old, but I have never been so disappointed by a game before in my life.  Even after seeing how beautiful the game looked, it wasn't enough to save the game experience.  BF2 I followed knowing I would wait until the reviews came out and after EA inevitably changed the online gameplay significantly in their attempts to fix issues.  After seeing the top posts on Reddit over the past couple of days I really hope the gaming community sends a clear message to companies like EA, hitting them where they only will listen - their wallets.

I took the chance to ask them about MTX and whether they thought it was negatively or positively impacting the gaming industry and I was kind of stunned how few people it takes to make MTX insanely profitable.\n\nThey said that after GTA V came out and developers saw the huge success GTAV:O was having with their Shark Cards, it blew the industry wide open for everyone to try and find their own MTX system that worked. They said Advanced Warfare was the first ""test case"" so to speak where they tried to implement loot crates and they saw the huge potential but it needed a lot of refinement. Eventually, BO3 rolls around and it was ready to be released with a good system and plan in mind for MTX and loot crates were a huge profitable success. \n\nThey said that the most astonishing part though was how profitable these MTX schemes were by only having such small portion of player base buying into them. If at least a fraction (<10%) spent money, it was unbelievably profitable. Not only that, but there was the (<1%) who spend astronomical amounts of money alone and made up the bulk of the profits. They gave accounts of single individuals who would drop over $10k on loot crates alone. Those were the extremes, but it goes to show how effective the system could by pulling people to drop anywhere from small fortunes to $60 here and there on a frequent basis. Because of those few people, now we are where we are. The problem is that unless the larger community understands this situation and refuses to buy the ENTIRE game OUTRIGHT, it doesn\'t really matter or make a difference if we just ignore the MTX system when we play. By playing, we become complacent and agree to a small percentage of people dictating the experience the larger community has. Games are no longer being made for people like us, their being made for the few suckers that fall into the MTX system, but those few end up basically dictating the development of the entire game for the rest of us. \n\nTLDR; Unless people stop purchasing entire games outright, and not just resorting to ignoring MTX after buying the game, the small fraction of players who buy into these systems will always dictate that games revolve around a system of MTX. The only way for us to counteract the huge incentives these companies make by including MTX is by making them lose out on far larger amounts by having masses of people refusing to pay the initial $60 for the game in the first place. If not, we\'ve got a dreadful future to look forward to in the gaming community. \n---------------------------\n\nWe all need to follow through on this.

Star Wars Battlefront 2. As this is Disney property, it deeply concerns you as a company. \n\nI bought and played the first game. Not because I read good reviews and saw a fantastic game but simple because of the Star Wars brand. The power of that brand, as I’m sure you’re aware, is such that success is a given. However to my dismay that was literally the only good thing about the game. Sure it was a diversion, it was pretty, but they content was severely lacking. Now comes to the crux of the matter, EA had the audacity to put the solutions to those problems behind paywalls, make content only available if you pay for a season pass which is effectively purchasing a second game. This attitude and practise which has seeped into the gaming industry is unacceptable and Star Wars fans around the world expect better from Disney. We expect to be given a product which lives up to the epic storytelling and riches worlds of Star Wars. \n\nOn that note, enter Battlefront 2. EA will attempt to woo us with more content than the previous game. They will likely promise great profits for you, Disney. I ask though, at what cost? EA has taken micro transactions to the next level. In order to unlock some of the content they so happily brag about up to 40 hours of gameplay is required, or you can pay. The wonderful IP which Disney owns is enticing enough largely thanks to the movies recently produced by Disney, to cause player young and old to spend money to obtain the full game. This directly encourages players to gamble, loot boxes provide random items which may give an advantage against other players. While this is a common practise in the gaming industry now, as a community we hope that Disney could be a powerful force for change, at the very least in your own games. Encouraging gambling in your games just does not seem befitting for a company with your reputation. If EA cannot understand that then they do not deserve to be making your games. \n\nI will not be purchasing Battlefront 2, that will likely not affect the profits at all, however I hope that Disney is driven by more than just profits and that you might be that force for change in the gaming world, let Star Wars games be full, rich and untainted by blatant money grabbing. I have great respect for Disney and the family friendly entertainment you’ve long produced. This game and others EA will produce just do not belong in your portfolio of titles. \n\nThank you for reading,', ""You have to vote with your wallet.

I’m not well studied on this topic, but the unfortunate success of mobile must have had a big role in paving the way to these bullshit concepts being pulled into regular paid games.  I know that my kids are relatively numb to it, and I take opportunities to talk about it when we play together.  A few weeks ago we were playing the “new” Minecraft on console and bought 500 “coins” or something, then bought a map pack for like 300 - I explained how the system takes advantage of people by making it feel like we aren’t spending real money, and how now we have 200 coins left that we don’t actually need, which makes it tempting to buy random stuff we don’t want, or buy another 500 to get another thing we do want.  My actual numbers are probably off here.  I then reminded them of the times they “accidentally” blew loads of money in mobile games without really understanding how much it had cost us!\n\nIn the end I believe that the economics will work out in some fashion that’s not too terrible for gamers, but the fixed $60 price tag isn’t likely to have much life left.

Before that is was looked at as the good franchise while the kids played CoD.  Now both CoD and Battlefield are for kids.

They charge you 150 for the entire game or will sell it to you piece mill as they ""release"" the other parts of the game.  This also splits the players base in half because people who dont buy DLC cant play on the maps.  You most likely will pay 150 and never touch 4 out of the 5 expansions.

I know it sucks that EA currently has the Star Wars license and that means we probably won\'t get any good Star Wars games for a couple years but it\'s not the end of the world. There are plenty of games that don\'t have loot boxes and are totally good, and aside from that the only reason loot boxes even exist is because everyone got so pissy about paid DLC that companies had to find another way to make more than $60 a game since that isn\'t enough to pay for what modern AAA titles are. Everyone in this thread is talking about ""acting like adults"" without really acknowledging that this is all basically over the fact that people don\'t like the new Star Wars toy and are upset that other people are going to buy it. I feel no remorse for anyone who picks this game up only to realize how big of a shitshow it is, but in the end it\'s literally just a game. Personally I never minded paid DLC as long as the base game felt substantial since I know that devs need to make more money to cover the cost of these games and if I liked the base game it was normally worth it for me to pay a little extra for some extra content and play time. I agree that the loot boxes system in BF2 (and specifically the type that unlock key gameplay components, I think purely cosmetic loot boxes like in Overwatch are completely fine) is absurd but calling it gambling is a bit of a stretch, it\'s definitely a shitty business practice and totally hurts the consumer, but in terms of gambling it\'s maybe on par with buying a blind box toy where some toys are definitively better than others and chances are you\'re just going to be disappointed in your purchase. In the end just keep in mind that this is all over a game that is meant to be fun in your free time, so while it might be annoying if you get it only to realize that it\'s not as fun as you hoped, the world isn\'t over and that there will be plenty of other games that will be fun. For anyone who does get or has been burned by a situation like this, I recommend next time you buy a game wait a week or two to see what people think, and remember that if you wait a couple months you can normally pick these up for well under retail and maybe get 2 or 3 games for $60 rather than just one.\n\nedit: Also sidenote, is anyone actually that mad about being able to play as sequel characters in prequel settings and vice versa?

We’ve done this with the closed alpha, through the beta last month, and our Play First Trial. And we continue to make adjustments based on your feedback as the game launches worldwide this week. Listening, and providing choices in how you play, will always be our principle with Star Wars Battlefront II. We want to ensure the game is balanced and fun both today and for years into the future.\n\nMaking games great comes from regular tuning. As one example, today we’re making a substantial change based on what we’ve seen during the Play First trial. There’s been a lot of discussion around the amount of in-game credits (and time) it takes to unlock some of our heroes, especially Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader. Unlocking a hero is a great accomplishment in the game, something we want players to have fun earning. We used data from the beta to help set those levels, but it’s clear that more changes were needed. \n\nSo, we’re reducing the amount of credits needed to unlock the top heroes by 75%. Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader will now be available for 15,000 credits; Emperor Palpatine, Chewbacca, and Leia Organa for 10,000 credits; and Iden at 5,000 credits. Based on what we’ve seen in the trial, this amount will make earning these heroes an achievement, but one that will be accessible for all players.\n\nIt's a big change, and it’s one we can make quickly. It will be live today, with an update that is getting loaded into the game.\n\nWe’ve also been listening to how much you’re loving features in the game (Starfighter Assault, 40 player MP battles, Darth Maul lightsaber throws, etc.) as well as what you haven’t liked. We know some of our most passionate fans, including those in our subreddit, have voiced their opinions, and we hear you. We’re making the changes to the credit levels for unlocking heroes and we’re going to keep making changes to improve the game experience over time. We welcome the conversation.\n\nIn fact, this Wednesday we’d like you to join us for a Reddit AMA with some of the key leads on our team. Stay tuned to our social channels for more info on the AMA, and our blog for continual updates on what we’re seeing, hearing and adjusting in the game.\n\nFor those of you already playing, thank you. For those of you looking forward to playing the Star Wars™ game you’ve been waiting for, thank you, too. The team is fully committed to listening to our community, continually adjusting the game, and providing even more great Star Wars content over the upcoming months and years of live service updates. More to come.\nShare\nhttps://www.ea.com/games/starwars/battlefront/battlefront-2/news/swbfii-changes-launch?utm_campaign=swbf2_hd_ww_ic_soco_twt_swbfii-launchchangesblog-tw&utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&****=41287&ts=1510608670004\n\n"", 'i cancelled my order', ""What's wrong with Rey in the Clone Wars?

Evangelicals have always had a hate-hate relationship with pop culture, but D&D panic became mainstream a little bit due to the general ""Satanic panic"" craze, as well as a specific case with James Dallas Egbert where lawmen incorrectly speculated D & D drove his behavior (a failed suicide attempt.) The old movie Mazes and Monsters is a fictionalized retelling of that case.\n\nThe Satanic Panic in general is something that tends to be forgotten now. People believed that there were cabals of satanists around that abused children and did other nasty things, due to a couple trials that heavily relied on the now discredited idea of repressed memories. This was mostly a secular idea. The meme joke ""show me on the doll where he touched you"" came from this, but was used along with leading questions to get vulnerable kids to confess to being abused in utterly bizarre and false ways. It\'s something that reads like it was straight out of fiction, but it really happened in the 1980s, and D&D was close enough to get hit in the crossfire from it.\n\nIt happened mostly as a reaction to the rise of mass media and the pretty harsh amount of social change we saw in the 80s. It\'s actually scarier that it was forgotten so quickly; if you grew up in that time, the fact that people literally thought it existed, and that it shaped pop culture in not a few ways, has always troubled me. It actually affected Christian fundamentalist belief in that it spawned the ""spiritual warfare"" trope and heightened belief in the existence and power of demons to influence people\'s behavior. A good example of this is in the novel ""This Present Darkness"" by Frank Peretti, which was my generation\'s Left Behind. And people actually milked this behavior; the Christian comedian Mike Warnke among others actually claimed to be ex satanists of the moral panic variety.\n\nIt\'s really a cautionary tale of how people act during times of social panic and what can set them off. It\'s not actually religion alone; religious people opposed the advent of the bar code, for one, and never saw the level of demonization at the secular level we did with D&D. (Though we do have to thank them for really linking bar codes with dehumanization, for example; sometimes religious critique can actually be dead on in emotional tone, while not on facts.) But if secular people on the whole are vulnerable, you get these ideas transmitted widespread.\n\nJust posting this if you think parents forbidding people from playing D&D is solely hyper religious nutcases. A lot of secular people fell for it too, and its too easy to fall into the idea that normal people can\'t fall prey to moral panic ideas.\n\n', 'My Bible teacher at my Christian School got me into D&D', 'Ha nerds', 'Enjoy your time in the [Fires of Hell](https://olddungeonmaster.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/fires-of-hell-5e.pdf), old man.', 'Is this starter set good?

You feel self aware, and a bit nervous for some reason, but you maintain calm. You see people looking at you, but you can\'t really get a sense of what they think. You also notice that everyone is wearing a name tag, including you. And you also realize that you seem to be the only male person there. Suspicious, but intriguing.

You see no name tag, and she\'s wearing a vail over her head, so you can\'t see her face. Carolina asks you to sit down in front of her, on a pillow. You have a seat. And you notice movement in the room. There\'s more people here, in the back. Your eyes adjust to the light, and you see them cuddling, kissing... oh, ok... what is this room? ""This is my friend"" Carolina says, and yor focus shifts again to the vailed woman in the center of the room.\n\n""We\'re playing a game, and you will decide where it leads. The rules are simple.
