2,new,gaming,The survival mode in the original modern warfare 3 makes no sense.,The reason why it doesn't make sense id because the overlord can communicate with you which if you are really stranded then he shouldn't be able to contact you. You can also call for backup from one of the cabinets on the map and they can send a helicopter with troops to help you but they can't send a helicopter to pick you up. When you die the overlord gives you a rating and he either say good job or you can do better. The only way the survival mode would make sense is if it was in a simulation like in Halo's multiplayer.,2024-09-10 15:41:56,Fancy-Advice-2793,0,False,"['Finally, someone has found a plot hole in the normally airtight plots of the Call of Duty series.

IMO it's better then zombies."", ""I get what you're saying - The survival mode in Modern Warfare 3 has several significant inconsistencies. Firstly, the core concept of the mode assumes that players are completely isolated and stranded. However, the fact that the Overlord can constantly communicate with you is quite confusing. If you‚Äôre truly cut off and unable to call for help, it doesn‚Äôt make sense for someone to be able to communicate with you.\n\nAdditionally, you can call for backup from cabinets scattered around the map, and a helicopter with troops will come to assist you. However, this helicopter doesn‚Äôt come to pick you up. This creates a major inconsistency, as it seems strange that a unit capable of sending assistance cannot perform the basic function of picking you up.\n\nWhen you die, the Overlord gives you a rating and comments on your performance, either saying ‚Äúgood job‚Äù or ‚Äúyou could do better.‚Äù This feedback seems out of place given the context of being in a life-or-death situation and completely isolated.\n\nGiven these issues, the survival mode would make much more sense if it were set in a simulation environment. A simulation framework, like the one in Halo‚Äôs multiplayer, would provide a more coherent explanation for these anomalies. For instance, if the mode were described as a type of training simulation or test environment, the Overlord‚Äôs ability to communicate and the responses to help calls would fit better within that context. This would make the experience more consistent and believable for the player."", 'Hot take: That survival mode beats out any zombies content CoD has ever put out.', 'idk if you know but zombies mode in all the other CODs also makes no sense. zombies arent real']",9,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1fdesg6/the_survival_mode_in_the_original_modern_warfare/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1fdesg6/the_survival_mode_in_the_original_modern_warfare/

5,new,gaming,Do you think video games can be spiritual?,"For anyone spiritual out there, we are aware that all things in life are interconnected by a common essence.

Video games are no exception.

It may sound silly that video games can be spiritual, but why would they be any different from anything else? The truth is they aren't.

Even games like Diablo and Assassin's Creed, to name two examples, are based on legit esotericism.

When it's all on song that to me is your spirituality.\n\nBut I think it's quite right to say that video games explore spiritual things. Computer graphics is a ripe medium to explore the ephemeral. It's completely imaginative.\n\nMystical realms are regularly explored through video games - the idea of ghosts, spirits, spells, hidden powers and so forth. It does so in quite a mature way often, too - I think of Elden Ring and the way a lot is unsaid, but yet it doesn't shy away from exploring these occult concepts, primarily through images.\n\nSometimes, if 'spirituality' is too overt and forced, people can turn away from it. So I think an ambiguous and subtle tone regarding esoteric matters can be a sensible approach.\n\nWe know in cinema sound and moving pictures combine to create moments of euphoria, and looking ahead even to VR, I can't see why those techniques and themes can't continue to evolve through the medium of realtime CGI ."", 'After playing ""GRIS"" I felt kinda refreshing or like free from some burden.', ""RELIGION is a scam, invented by ancient shamans to exert control over gullible masses.\n\nI understand it brings you a ton of calmness, thinking that when that bus hits you because you didn't look both ways, there will be some paradise waiting for you where you will live forever.

It\'s about the same amount of attention as Crash Bandicoot got, and that character was absolutely foundational to PlayStation. It\'s not an insult or slight in any way.

Being a dad and teaching my 6 year old how to play Zelda and watch him tackle challenges on his own is probably the coolest thing about having kids.', 'Story time.\n\nI was very good at halo going into uni. I was the best on campus, and no one else was very close for the first year or two I was there.  At the start, people would just come in and watch me play MLG matchmaking or customs with my other good friends.  Many of them wanted a shot, so we would play 2s-4s on matchmaking, and I would let them ruin my rank, so I could build it back up for them to ruin again.  Eventually, there was enough interest that we had 8 guys who wanted to play.  \n\nWe had enough interest, so we played LANs. We would set up two CRT tv\'s in different two rooms and connect them with an Ethernet cable through the hallway.  At the start we would have to scrap to get 8 people to play, pounding on doors and pulling guys from their girlfriends.  Sometimes we played 2v2s or 3v3s, but NEVER anything but true MLG rules.  \n\nMy team would literally never lose if I was playing full on, so I played lazy most of the time so it kept the games fairer.  I would give up snipes/shotty/rockets everytime to let everyone else practice.  I would even pretend to have homework, pass the controller, and coach one team while I ""wrote a paper.""  \n\nThese were my boys.  After a few months, my boys got very, very good.\n\nBy the end of our freshman year, we had 10-12 guys every night playing competitive games.  We would play in my dorm from after dinner til one or two am.  There was ALWAYS someone in my room, on my xbox, even if we weren\'t LANing.  We even had four upper classmen who were on sports teams (they lived in different dorms) challenge our best four.  Then I played full on. There were around ten guys watching these games, and I got a few killtacs.  One memorable killtac was on Ascension and it was a full chamber, four headshot sniper killtac.  The room exploded and kids ran from my room to the other room just to trashtalk in the middle of the game.  They lost around 10 in a row before they left without saying good game. The upper classmen wouldn\'t let me play against them anymore, but they loved having me over to carry them in BTB or whatever shit they played. \n\nSophomore year started and a new batch of freshman came in.  This added six more guys.    An upperclassman transfer heard about us, so he joined.  He was as good as I was, so we were always team captains to keep games balanced (he might have been a bit better than I was, but I would never tell him that.  He was the pointguard for our school\'s basketball team and absurdly cocky at the time. We would later become roommates and he was in my wedding).  At this point, we had far too many people and we had to figure out ways to get everyone a chance.  Bottom two +/- players from each team passed the controller.  At around this time, I no longer had to play lazy, and some of my friends that were shit at the start were outperforming me.  It got to the point where we had 6-8 guys who were close to the same skill level.  We could make very competitive teams, and my Junior year, it had gotten very competitive.  We would have halo drama complete with fights and shit. That was good fun too, because then I could take the training wheels off and talk trash a bit too. \n\nWe ended up sending a team of four to MLG Columbus in the early 00\'s.  We did not do great (shocker, I was a big fish in a little pond), but we played very respectably during scrims with other teams our level.  It was an amazing experience that I wouldn\'t trade for the world.

They very often have this outlook that the men saying these stuff are toxic or manipulative, and the girls are victims of this approach. What I often see is that these men have very little social skills. They try their best to get in touch with these girls, whom they view as strong, desirable and competent, in a way that they think is good. \n\nSome of them have really learnt that Mario(no joke) and Link are good role models. Not because they are depictions of how men actually behave, but because a lot of these boys and men have lacked a proper positive masculine role model in their real life. They use what they know. A man or boy being overly chivalrous, to a point where it‚Äôs weird even, is probably doing so because he has a very positive view of the girl he is talking to. And in his mind being kind and a good man(hero) for this girl means being chivalrous, coming to her aid, like Mario or Link(especially link is a very relatable character as he is brave, handsome and strong). To me this is nothing to make fun of. It‚Äôs rather very sad to see these boys and men try their best to reach out to someone they view as highly positive, and are left being made fun of and misunderstood. \n\nAnd make no mistake about it - you girls are viewed as positive! Some of these men might be weird, make you feel uncomfortable, some even toxic making gestures or approaches that is highly inappropriate. Being a girl meeting these men(online) is often difficult and very taxing because the men are lacking social skills that creates a good atmosphere. Since it‚Äôs the girls who know better in that situation they are the ones that finds it most uncomfortable. But, almost all the time their approaches and behaviour stems from them viewing you as positive. Not just attractive, but positive. Girls are viewed as kinder, emotionally smarter, easier to talk to, safer. A girl is a good friend too, and a lot of these men are missing that. Like they are sitting alone in the sandbox in kindergarten. And when they are weird, they are trying their best. When they ask if you have a boyfriend it‚Äôs their best attempt to find out if they can move closer or not. If they are toxic it‚Äôs because they often are angry that they are missing the positives a girl represents in their own life. Girls are in this story so much stronger than these men. \n\nIt is these men‚Äôs responsibility to mature and learn other ways to talk to girls, especially online. But it is so important to understand where these boys and men are coming from, to see the value they put on to you women. It is a sadness to see posts like this, because it makes it clear how these men are perceived. Them reaching out and doing their best comes across as weird and toxic. Imagine how much they struggle to get in touch with people, girls in particular. Imagine how lonely they are. \n\nIn my experience knowing where a behaviour comes from makes handling the impact of that behaviour a lot easier. Understand that a toxic man is being so because he finds what a woman represents unattainable. It‚Äôs a positive excluded from him. Downgrading female gamers is his way of dealing with that loss. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care anyway, I don‚Äôt need a girl in my life, they suck!‚Äù. Now he can believe that he can be okey without. Try to notice that dynamic, and see if you can feel some compassion for how isolated some of them feel.

Which as you can see, has led you to overgeneralized assumptions. \n\nYour last few questions are interesting and I'll answer them the best I can. Some women have shown a strong interest, (not as often, Ill give ya that lol), but most if not all, showed their attention and affection while in a relationship. I think that points more towards my decision-making, meaning I generally will not try and pursue a relationship with someone who is not giving me attention. That, I think, is where these 'lonely, attention-starved' men you speak of get it wrong. Not getting attention from someone purely because of their gender is ridiculous.

When you squeeze the trigger for both controllers, and there are two cars on the track, the power is distributed pretty evenly, but if one of the cars is knocked off the track or your opponent releases their trigger to break suddenly, then that power is instantaneously transferred to the other car and car number 2 sees a comparable boost in acceleration and velocity for the exact same applied trigger pressure.\n\nWhen I went to college I studied Electrical Engineering, and it makes sense as both tracks are wired in parallel, but at the time, it was just known as the method to knock your opponent from the track. Both racers accelerate so they are going as fast as they can without getting thrown from the track, then just before your opponent enters a turn, you drop your throttle and watch as your opponent now finds themselves accelerating into a turn.\n\nFor the rest of the evening my Father tried in vain to knock me from the track.

27,top,gaming,Can we please boycott Star Wars battlefront 2,"I bought EA Star Wars Battlefront as a fan of Star Wars and felt ripped off. Played the beta of Star Wars battlefront 2 and you still can't just get in a vehicle, it feels so fake. Why is Rey in the clone wars!? That is all bad, but EA have just totally taken the piss with abusing Star Wars fans and cutting their games into little pieces and bleeding the fan base dry. 

I've had enough.

Edit 1: Spelt Rey wrong sorry! Autocorrect and I didn't check.

Edit 2: Thank you so very much for the support that this post has received, it really has been quite overwhelming. This post is very much a quick outpouring of thoughts of mine rather then a well thought through argument focusing on the main issues with EA's Star Wars Battlefront 2. I only eluded to the main issues, rather than outright stating the unacceptable issues with loot boxes, progression grind, the pay to win aspects and the short campaign etc. However people who are on this sub reddit are very much aware of the main issues.

All I hope that this post has managed to bring attention to the main issues and bring about some positive change.  

Edit 3: Thank you kind strangers for the reddit gold!

What really needs to happen is for E3 to roll around. Let all the video game and console devs do their presentation. Then; when EA steps out, and only when EA steps out, people collectively \'boo\' and turn their backs throughout the whole presentation. The only thing gamers can do short of buying absolutely 0 EA games (unlikely) which would tank stocks, is to show them their actions have reached a pinnical of disappointment for their consumers.

I always assumed ""RIP inbox"" was a joke.\n\nEdit #2: Ok so since this is still a comment people are latching onto and I have access to my computer now, I guess I should make as few things a little clearer. I know it\'s all paid-to-clap press. Those people are paid to write \'best in E3 show!\' \'Battlefront 2 made me cry!\' \'#newEAgamelooksdope\' bias is part of their resume. \'Yes man\' their label. My point is that it would have to get to that moment where even the paid to gold seal \'reporters\' have had enough. Sadly, there will never be a universal ban on one publisher. For those who\'ve been in a guild, it\'s common knowledge gamers rarely will work together for the better of the whole without having their ego stroked as the one. I would assume this applies double for trying to ban a publisher. At this point, all you can do is the single most damaging thing to a major corporation; and that is to tank their stocks. Their PR will kiss shit stained player ass and do it with a smile. That\'s their job. What we need to start thinking as a whole collective is how to make their stock holders and CEO\'s start applying rose red lipstick and considering their go-to tongue action move. This means, actively boycotting all their products. Which nobody will do. I\'m favor of a comment I saw where someone suggested, as far as Battlefront II was concerned, attack Disney.

Disney stopped selling magic and childhood dreams mid-80\'s. What the fuck do they know about fun and happiness (anybody who points to their theme parks have clearly never stood 4-hours in line for a five minute ride)? That does mean however, we need to stop the cycle of being the industries bitches. Take some fucking responsibility. In many ways; these practices became practical to them because gamers (us) showed them that it was a viable business model. Like paying for a gold subscription on Xbox. DLC that is a few skin changes for guns or characters. Sloppy/shoddy/irrelevant pre-order bonuses. Games that were released buggy because a deadline had to be met (yet are rarely fixed once the cash in comes) If we as gamers want a more responsible publisher and game dev; we must become more responsible consumers of games.

It seems like a blatant cash grab in a premium title for home consoles. There\'s already been a backlash of millions of gamers against the game on the popular web community, Reddit.com.

I played a $20 game called Little Nightmares. Fun little game, few hours of levels. I enjoyed it. They have a new level for $4 or a bundle with even more levels for $10. I don\'t expect to get those things for free. It\'s an expansion to the base game, and it costs money.\n\nNow, you may feel like a game doesn\'t have enough content for $60 and the DLC should be included. But you have no right to expect that. The only thing you can do is buy or not buy a game. Your opinion is not fact in determining how much a game should cost.\n\nYou have to look at the game and decide if you want it and would enjoy it. I don\'t go see Guardians of the Galaxy in the theaters and then complain that they are making a second one and charging me more money for it and that they should have been in the same movie. It\'s an additional story. It doesn\'t just come for free. That would be entitlement.\n\nYou are acting entitled to think that this video game should offer EVERYTHING you want for $60 and anything extra should be free and everything should be unlocked so you can use it now and they shouldn\'t be allowed to have ANY form of additional revenue from this game.\n\nDo you know what that would do to the gaming industry? It would kill it. Developers aren\'t going to spend years making games to not profit off of them. Publishers aren\'t going to put hundreds of millions in making and marketing a game if they can only sell it for $60 and have no other revenue streams from it.\n\nBF2 is offering a year of free updates with new maps, new characters, new weapons, new gear, new story missions, new events, and more. Absolutely everything in this game you can unlock for free without paying a dime over $60. Some people will choose to pay extra money to unlock some things earlier than others. Will it give them an advantage in multiplayer? Possibly. The issue ISN\'T about paying to unlock items in a game. The issue is about how big of an advantage people who pay will have over those who don\'t.\n\nIn my experience, I\'ve played with 0 star cards active and consistently place in the top third of the team. I don\'t think star cards are giving people a huge advantage. It\'s also only in early trial. People acting like others have an advantage could just be poor at the game. Just because someone killed you and had a star card active doesn\'t mean you would have killed this if they didn\'t have that star card. And they could have earned the star card and not paid for it. It\'s just all too subjective to form some kind of ""boycott"" around. This is just a bandwagon for people to jump on to because it\'s trending and popular now to hate on this.\n\nYou obviously are free to do whatever you want, but don\'t expect everyone else to agree with your opinion. I for one am enjoying the game and think there is a lot of content and playability in the game. I\'m not going to buy loot boxes with real money, and I\'ll still have a good time.\n\nDo you not realize how you are being just as greedy as you claim EA is being? You want things for free and you want everything unlocked right away. You want to take away any and all progression in the game because that\'s what YOU want. You don\'t want them to have any means of making revenue from this game outside of the initial purchase price because you are too cheap to pay more for video games. It\'s like the people who complain that Netflix is raising their prices, but is just mooching off their parents account.

You, as the gamer, don\'t get to determine what the ""Full Game"" is. Just because there is DLC doesn\'t mean that should be included in the base game for $60.\n\nDoes it make sense that you can buy Luke and Vader, two core characters of the SW franchise? Nevertheless, I can agree to an extent that it\'s murky at times what can be counted as the \'full game\' and extra. I DO have a problem when it\'s very obviously parts of what was developed, chopped off and sold after the fact for more money. Imagine if Smash 4 gated Luigi behind 40 hours of gameplay or you could pay $5.99 to unlock him right away. That\'s obviously bullshit.\n\n>Now, you may feel like a game doesn\'t have enough content for $60 and the DLC should be included. But you have no right to expect that. The only thing you can do is buy or not buy a game. Your opinion is not fact in determining how much a game should cost.\n\nOf course I have a right, I\'m a consumer, and if they want to keep selling games they should listen to their consumers. We had fully functional games just 10 years prior without any of this crap. The problem with this business model is it\'s ruining the base game for it\'s own sake. It\'s exploitation for the sake of money. You\'re paying for characters that ARE in the base game that are gated behind a ludicrously long grind time. Older games didn\'t DO unlocks like that AT ALL. You had to clear the games with certain characters or in a certain amount of time or complete challenges. That\'s actually ENGAGING. This isn\'t.\n\n>You have to look at the game and decide if you want it and would enjoy it.

For one, movies are not the same as games, and two, you\'re talking about a sequel. Of course they have the right to charge for the sequel. \n\nA better analogy would be if they released the movie on DVD and all of the scenes showing Rocket Raccoon were cut out, but you either have to watch the movie 10 times or pay for the extra special edition to see them.\n\n>You are acting entitled to think that this video game should offer EVERYTHING you want for $60 and anything extra should be free and everything should be unlocked so you can use it now and they shouldn\'t be allowed to have ANY form of additional revenue from this game.\n\nNo, I just think microtransactions are a fucking stupid business model and locking things behind a grind to coerce payment for them is exploiting consumers. They know damn well whales will pony up. \n\nI don\'t think DLC in of itself is a bad idea if it\'s done correctly. You know what actually used to be REALLY good? Expansion Packs. That was \'DLC\' before DLC and it was often fully featured story content, characters, game modes, etc. Something I would gladly pay $29.99 for or so, because it\'s not compromising the base game or the base experience.\n\n>Do you know what that would do to the gaming industry? It would kill it. Developers aren\'t going to spend years making games to not profit off of them.

They should either reduce their development costs, raise prices, or seek, I don\'t know, ANY OTHER REVENUE STREAM THAN MICROTRANSACTIONS. They demonstrably damage a game experience. \n\n>BF2 is offering a year of free updates with new maps, new characters, new weapons, new gear, new story missions, new events, and more. Absolutely everything in this game you can unlock for free without paying a dime over $60. Some people will choose to pay extra money to unlock some things earlier than others. Will it give them an advantage in multiplayer? Possibly. **The issue ISN\'T about paying to unlock items in a game. The issue is about how big of an advantage people who pay will have over those who don\'t.**\n\nThis is a very poor argument. It IS about paying to unlock items. It\'s about how they purposefully -designed- the free unlocking method to make more money and compromised the progression. It\'s not fun or engaging at all. \n\nI\'m not a massive fan of DLC, but I would rather pay for those things you mentioned as an expansion than have it nickel and dime\'d from people and having my progression turned into a grindfest.\n\nAs I mentioned before, take Super Smash Bros. You could unlock things in a reasonable time, through various creative challenges, like \'beat the game with only 3 lives and no continues\', or \'clear all the bonus stages\'. You know why that\'s NOT in BFII? Because if you could unlock them in interesting ways without a grind, nobody would pay for the microtransactions! There is no value in the way you unlock things here, you are literally paying money in place of TIME. Is the core game experience probably otherwise fun to play? Sure, I don\'t think many people are disputing that. But you have to play it for countless HOURS to get things that are already in the game, grinding to get the character you want if you don\'t want to pay money. I would argue this method of unlocking characters is strictly inferior to the \'SSB\' model.\n\n>You obviously are free to do whatever you want, but don\'t expect everyone else to agree with your opinion. I for one am enjoying the game and think there is a lot of content and playability in the game. I\'m not going to buy loot boxes with real money, and I\'ll still have a good time.\n\nAs you wish. If you enjoy the base experience, good for you. I\'d just like to get you to see WHY this is a dealbreaker for many people.\n\n>Do you not realize how you are being just as greedy as you claim EA is being? You want things for free and you want everything unlocked right away. You want to take away any and all progression in the game because that\'s what YOU want. You don\'t want them to have any means of making revenue from this game outside of the initial purchase price because you are too cheap to pay more for video games. It\'s like the people who complain that Netflix is raising their prices, but is just mooching off their parents account. If you aren\'t willing to pay the price of the content, then your opinion doesn\'t\' really matter. You don\'t just get what you want for free because you want it.\n\nNo, I want the progression system to be fair and non-grindy, and not designed as a way to coerce people to pay money. It should not take me 40 hours to unlock Vader.  \n\nLet me put it this way: If there were NO microtransactions at ALL in the game, and grinding currency for extensive amounts of time was the ONLY way to unlock things in the game, would you still think it was a good progression system, when I\'ve clearly demonstrated that it\'s been done better? ', ""If you're paying full price of a game on release, everything needs to be unlocked. You can't have a F2P model on a fully priced game, plain and simple. Just comparing the experience I could get on Battlefront 2 with the one I got for the same price in TW3? It's fucking laughable."", "">everything needs to be unlocked.\n\nNah, this is bullshit. Do you also boycott Mario Kart because not every character is unlocked, or boycott Pokemon because not all Pokemon can be obtained? Nintendo literally lock 20 or more Pokemon behind a paywall and call it two different versions, yet people have no problem with that. To think everything should be unlocked is entitled as fuck. EA have gone to the extreme here, but the issue isn't that everything should be unlocked, it's the length that you have to go to to unlock everything that is absolute bullshit."", 'Do you unlock Mario Kart characters by throwing additional money at the game? When you play Pokemon, do you get charged every time you catch a new one? Confusing gameplay progression with actual in-game transactions is just asinine. Please try again. ', 'No you don‚Äôt pay for them. But you also don‚Äôt have to pay for them in BFII either.', 'But paying for them considerably improves your experience and gives you a huge advantage over players not willing to pay. Considering loot crates are the only way to level up, you are quite literally paying to win. In a PvP game. Do you really see no issue with that? Not to mention better gear and stat boosts. Higher level also unlocks more stat boosts. I could keep going. ', 'On the wii u dlc tracks and characters you had to pay', 'No, in Pokemon you have to buy a different version of the game you just bought to catch some of them.', ""Oh so you had every weapon and ability unlocked in the Witcher 3 from the start? You didn't need to level up and earn XP and unlock loot and gear and craft things? That's weird. \n\nEvery game had a progression and unlock system. Hell. Even the first BF had one with star cards. Battlefield 1 has it, Gears of War has it, Call of Duty has it, Titanfall has it. It's a common thing. This isn't new. In non-shooters like RPGs you have to play a lot to unlock things. Stop acting like this is the problem. The ONLY problem us if the unlocks give a significant advantage to those who have them. So far I don't see a major advantage. Just balanced gameplay. "", ""That comparison is so fucking horrible, please try again. None of TW3's content is gated behind paywalls and imaginary currencies which can be bought with actual money. If I want to, I can mod or input a cheat and wear any armor I fucking please whenever I want. "", ""It's YOUR comparison. Not my fault there is flaws in it. \n\nPlaying a game to unlock better gear and abilities is a staple of video games.

TW3 doesn't lock any content behind a paywall. TEE HEE, IF YOU SPEND 500 SCHMECKELS, YOU CAN GET THIS JUICY ARMOR SOONER THAN USUAL. Trying to justify micro-transactions by claiming that unlocking gear and abilities is a staple of video games is a perversion of the very mechanic people find enjoyable. Which is progression. Not because some schmuck with his daddy's credit card managed to buy two new blasters and Han Solo's panties. If TW3 offered me a way to buy armor for money in what is already a fully priced game, you're damn right I'd be fucking pissed. But they didn't. "", 'Progression should never have a monetary shortcut.', ""Honestly, I probably didn't express myself in the best way.

He uses Battlefront as an example. He\'s trying to make the point that $60 doesn\'t get you the full game. $60 for the core game and then $50 for the DLC. That\'s $110 dollars. In 1987, an NES game was ~$50. Adjusted for inflation, that\'s $110 in today\'s dollars. So, $110 for Double Dragon, $110 for Battlefront and all its content. Now, consider that you don\'t *have* to buy the DLC. The fact of the matter is it\'s cheaper today to be a gamer than it was in my youth, especially when you consider the pre-owned market, something that didn\'t exist in gaming\'s nascent years. I know I sound old-man ""I had to walk uphill in the snow to school, both ways"" about it, but facts is facts. It\'s not as though companies are saying it\'s $60 for the core game, and then for an additional $50 we\'ll let you install it. Opinions differ on the first Battlefront, but for a casual gamer such as myself $60 got me a gorgeous, simplistic, and mindless shooter that I could sit in front of for an hour or two here and there and blow shit up, all for less than the cost of shitty lasagna with the fam at the Olive Garden. Lots of people hated the game. They\'re probably a lot better at shooting people with imaginary lasers than I am. As for this release, I\'d rather see people trashing it on its merits rather than trashing it because EA, a company that employs people in a challenging industry, is trying to turn a profit. This probably sounds like I\'m defending EA. I\'m not. Corporations fucking suck in too many ways to count. But I don\'t begrudge them their prerogative to make choices that they believe will lead to success in their industry. As people have said - as consumers we have purchasing power, and the best way to effect change is with your wallet. If you don\'t like what they\'re doing, don\'t buy the game. More power to that. I just don\'t see this economic model as the egregious unethical cash-grab it\'s being made out to be. Lots of people saying \'make the games $100 and include all the content\'. Maybe that\'s the way to go? Time will tell.  ', ""Here's the thing about back then versus now, back then games didn't sell nearly the amount of copies that they do now, battlefront 2015 sold over 14 million copies before the end of that march, even assuming that EA makes only half the amount that the game sells for on each sale, that's 420 million dollars, on a game that probably costed about 50 million to make. These companies aren't struggling to make a profit on the initial sales of a 60$ game, there's no reason why we need a price increase just because of inflation because increase in sales more than took care of that problem."", ""Eh, not really. I think we can agree that Battlefront is an A-list title - one of the highest selling games on modern platforms. A 'good' title on the NES, for instance, might sell 2-3 million copies. Adjust that for inflation and you're looking at earnings around $300 million. Some titles, like the Super Mario series, Zelda, etc. sold much more. Consider too that these games were being made with far smaller budgets, and smaller development teams. These guys were maximizing profit, too - they're driven by $, not some mythical good-guy ethos. The time and complexity involved in creating today's big-name titles results in budgets that exceed hundreds of millions of dollars. Battlefront was almost certainly more expensive to develop than the 50 million figure you mention. No one is saying that EA is 'struggling' to make a profit, but the industry is notoriously volatile, and EA has figured out that DLC etc. is a model that is working - like it or not people are paying the cash to get loot, upgrades, maps, etc. This may seem like an evil scheme to some, to others it's just adapting to changes across the industry. I think that they've kept the core game at an affordable price point, and while I've yet to play it it doesn't seem to be lacking for content (single-player campaign, multiplayer, etc), and for people that want to spend the extra cash they can get the extra stuff. Indie studios and small developers exist in many cases to make art. Big publicly traded studios like EA exist to make money, and people expecting them to play by any other set of rules will end up disappointed.

Hyperbole much? This is entertainment, not life-saving-drugs. This isn't Martin Shkreli increasing the price of critical pharmaceuticals by 1000%. What is EA guilty of? In this case, it's giving the player two options: they can buy credits to unlock shit, or they can grind it out for the credits. Is that being a dick? Seems like most people think so - I'm not among them. Maybe sales #s will suck for BF2 and EA and others will say 'welp, microtransactions are dead' - if so, cool. But at the end of the day, they have a responsibility to their employees, and to their shareholders, to be successful - and they're gonna find a way. Maybe it's less content, maybe it's smaller games/titles, maybe it's $100 price points. I think it's important we don't conflate a lack of altruism on the part of a company like EA with a lack of ethics. I'll circle back around to the relative cost of gaming -- even with all this DLC/microtransaction circle jerk stuff, gaming is more affordable than it's ever been; it is a relatively inexpensive form of entertainment, and I sometimes think the sheer volume of platforms and titles out there has dulled us a little to just how amazing these virtual worlds that we get to play in are - and the work/cost on the part of developers and their teams to create them.

Now let's aim low and say EA makes 30$ on every game purchase, it's probably more like 50$ but hey let's give them the benefit of the doubt. Do the math and that's 420 million dollars.

Before EA made a PR disaster out of this whole thing, I was on Reddit crusading against this game and it\'s exploitative nature; it is pay to win, let\'s not split hairs about it. I would post on various forums and threads to try to get others to see the light and I received an insane amount of hate for it. I\'m glad people are finally coming around in big numbers, better late than never and I mean that sincerely. \n\nI am a huge Star Wars fan, going way back to when I was a little kid and watched *A New Hope* for the first time with my dad. I was hooked instantly. I owned the original Battlefront games (the good ones) on the OG Xbox, and I bought the 2015 Battlefront for the Xbone a few days after it launched. That was the only game I played for days. I loved it so much (hindsight is 20/20, it was 100% nostalgia, the game was bare bones), all I could think was I wanted more content so I bought the season pass. Long story short I got burned for almost $120. That\'s no one\'s fault but my own, even though I blame EA for shitty scumbag business practices and making a fucking season pass $50. It split the player base up to an unplayable state, the same thing is happening all over again right now to Battlefield 1. \n\nWhen the ring of YouTube reviewers I trust (AngryJoe, TB, ACG etc.) began coming out saying this game was pay to win, I was immediately turned off. Then I played the ""beta"" or as actual gamers like to call it the ""demo"", and my only thought was ""hm, I\'ve played this game before. It\'s the same damn thing, just a polished turd."" Suffice to say I will spend my money elsewhere. It\'s not a *great* game to start with and the loot boxes make it criminal. We, as gamers, should not and will not stand for this bullshit. This game will probably sell millions of copies, I won\'t lie. However, 130K people read OP\'s post and gave it an upvote. If that many potential customers choose to say *fuck this game*, it will absolutely hurt EA\'s sales.

Sure, plenty of people skip the campaign modes in Call of Duty or Battlefield, which are video game franchises, and I‚Äôm included in that.

I took the chance to ask them about MTX and whether they thought it was negatively or positively impacting the gaming industry and I was kind of stunned how few people it takes to make MTX insanely profitable.\n\nThey said that after GTA V came out and developers saw the huge success GTAV:O was having with their Shark Cards, it blew the industry wide open for everyone to try and find their own MTX system that worked. They said Advanced Warfare was the first ""test case"" so to speak where they tried to implement loot crates and they saw the huge potential but it needed a lot of refinement. Eventually, BO3 rolls around and it was ready to be released with a good system and plan in mind for MTX and loot crates were a huge profitable success. \n\nThey said that the most astonishing part though was how profitable these MTX schemes were by only having such small portion of player base buying into them. If at least a fraction (<10%) spent money, it was unbelievably profitable. Not only that, but there was the (<1%) who spend astronomical amounts of money alone and made up the bulk of the profits. They gave accounts of single individuals who would drop over $10k on loot crates alone. Those were the extremes, but it goes to show how effective the system could by pulling people to drop anywhere from small fortunes to $60 here and there on a frequent basis. Because of those few people, now we are where we are. The problem is that unless the larger community understands this situation and refuses to buy the ENTIRE game OUTRIGHT, it doesn\'t really matter or make a difference if we just ignore the MTX system when we play. By playing, we become complacent and agree to a small percentage of people dictating the experience the larger community has. Games are no longer being made for people like us, their being made for the few suckers that fall into the MTX system, but those few end up basically dictating the development of the entire game for the rest of us. \n\nTLDR; Unless people stop purchasing entire games outright, and not just resorting to ignoring MTX after buying the game, the small fraction of players who buy into these systems will always dictate that games revolve around a system of MTX. The only way for us to counteract the huge incentives these companies make by including MTX is by making them lose out on far larger amounts by having masses of people refusing to pay the initial $60 for the game in the first place. If not, we\'ve got a dreadful future to look forward to in the gaming community. \n---------------------------\n\nWe all need to follow through on this.

What is different now is that in the middle of a game, if one was playing an arcade game, to necessary experience the entirety of the game - you have to pay just a measly quarter to finish.

It's not that micro-transactions should not take place, some games and companies cannot compete without the process to survive. Rather, we should as a community label and recognize that companies should be held accountable for the quality/content of their product (just like any other product) and determine individually if that product is worthy of sell value. **Especially** for micro-transactions, as it snowballs across the entire market for quality games.\n\nIt's not possible, to stop micro-transactions, but what is possible is to create a constructive criticism environment for the value/worth of a product.\n\nFor example, Rockstar games recently [commented on the nature of their future *Red Dead 2* game,]( https://www.dailystar.co.uk/tech/gaming/659104/Rockstar-news-Red-Dead-Redemption-2-release-GTA-5-Online-update-LA-Noire-Switch-boost) and mictro-transactions within the game.\n\n Essentially no company will listen, or understand a community because it is nothing more than business owners being competitive. It is understandable, but it is impacting the **quality** of games, the release of those games, and in whole the experience of video games. The only way, to grab their attention is as a community boycott and place the control back into the community of gamers.\n\n"", ""After the first piece of shit game I said never again.

Star Wars Battlefront 2. As this is Disney property, it deeply concerns you as a company. \n\nI bought and played the first game. Not because I read good reviews and saw a fantastic game but simple because of the Star Wars brand. The power of that brand, as I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre aware, is such that success is a given. However to my dismay that was literally the only good thing about the game. Sure it was a diversion, it was pretty, but they content was severely lacking. Now comes to the crux of the matter, EA had the audacity to put the solutions to those problems behind paywalls, make content only available if you pay for a season pass which is effectively purchasing a second game. This attitude and practise which has seeped into the gaming industry is unacceptable and Star Wars fans around the world expect better from Disney. We expect to be given a product which lives up to the epic storytelling and riches worlds of Star Wars. \n\nOn that note, enter Battlefront 2. EA will attempt to woo us with more content than the previous game. They will likely promise great profits for you, Disney. I ask though, at what cost? EA has taken micro transactions to the next level. In order to unlock some of the content they so happily brag about up to 40 hours of gameplay is required, or you can pay. The wonderful IP which Disney owns is enticing enough largely thanks to the movies recently produced by Disney, to cause player young and old to spend money to obtain the full game. This directly encourages players to gamble, loot boxes provide random items which may give an advantage against other players. While this is a common practise in the gaming industry now, as a community we hope that Disney could be a powerful force for change, at the very least in your own games. Encouraging gambling in your games just does not seem befitting for a company with your reputation. If EA cannot understand that then they do not deserve to be making your games. \n\nI will not be purchasing Battlefront 2, that will likely not affect the profits at all, however I hope that Disney is driven by more than just profits and that you might be that force for change in the gaming world, let Star Wars games be full, rich and untainted by blatant money grabbing. I have great respect for Disney and the family friendly entertainment you‚Äôve long produced.

They obviously knew it was too much, which is why they had the the price presented as far lower to give the illusion to reviewers that the grind was more acceptable.\n\nI got to like the 2015 Battlefront - I still play it, and in spite of the fact its still unbalanced and not-quite-finished like so many EA games, really enjoy it. But it was basically $60 dollars for loaned content, and up to $100 for content that most people weren't even accessing. The DLC is almost abandoned. We couldn't even just load an empty map and LOOK AROUND, and its obvious the EA has learnt nothing since about consumer value. But having to participate in this gratuitous and kafkaesque economy that has been designed to frustrate people is the pits. I would be more willing to pay $60 for EA to just fix the 2015 game. It says a lot about them when they announced the sequel before it had even been released. EA is the premature ejaculation of video games; at first glance, pleasing, pleasurable, but ever unfinished, and thus, never fully satisfying. Also, a prick.\n\nI will pay 70 dollars for a big game. I will not pay 60 dollars, PLUS whatever the fuck else later on so that my A-Wing turns a bit more. "", 'Why has this never seemed like an issue until now?

Boycott games like COD WWII which is a litteral scam with a silly campaign and the same old combat thats been in every other Call of Duty game plus the ridiculous loot boxes and Destiny rip off social area.  0 significant new features, same garbage, boycott justified.  Battlefront 2 is actually like hundreds of times better than Battlefront in terms of gameplay and improvements on what players suggested.  We have more true to form combat without everyone just jumping around in jetpacks and we have a much better but not perfect system for getting heroes/vehicles (I agree, a system where you can get in and out of vehicles would be far better).  We have the different classes which is my favorite addition (shoulda been in Battlefront 1) where your role is far more defined and interesting rather than just picking a weapon and star cards.  I think that a more attainable Darth Vader would be far better, but I think there is room in the game to actually earn some not easy achievements through dedication, like unlocking Darth Vader.  Also, I hope we can all agree that the graphics look amazing and the gameplay is legitimately fun (ive played the Beta and Trial).  I am not an EA fanboy, I was really mad with the first Battlefront and some features in BF1, but please, yes it is a flawed and imperfect game but what game isn't?  Progress is being made and it isn't a 100% money grab like other games are.

Grow up people "", ""Having a hero class join into battles is cosmetic?  Luke or Vader doesn't change the tide of a battle?  The entire mode Hero Vs Villains is cosmetic and doesn't add to the game at all?  \n\nPeople aren't upset about the fact that uber weapons will be unlocked and used day one.  They are upset that the main story line characters, that are available on the disk from the second the game launches, is behind a paywall, unless you grind the game for over 40 hours.  Since most people don't have 40 straight hours to spend playing a game, it will take a few weeks or more to even begin experiencing the full breadth of the game they purchased.  "", ""People invest well more than 40 hours into a game.

You are making a blanket statement about a vast array of games to avoid the topic at hand.\n\nIf they want to put those characters behind a time lock, fine.  Don't make the pay-to-win.

There's a disproportionate amount of kids running around fully geared out because they are given free reign in the store. When you have the best gear money can buy, your skill doesn't have to be as high as everyone else's. \n\nSo, the mode Heroes Vs Villians (one of the most popular modes from the first game) isn't going to suffer from having one or two characters available to use for a couple of weeks of matches? That's a mode that's 100% reliant on having hero characters unlocked. What about the other modes? The starter heroes are just Gunners (Finn, Han) and the P2W crew are Force whipping everyone around.

I know it sucks that EA currently has the Star Wars license and that means we probably won\'t get any good Star Wars games for a couple years but it\'s not the end of the world. There are plenty of games that don\'t have loot boxes and are totally good, and aside from that the only reason loot boxes even exist is because everyone got so pissy about paid DLC that companies had to find another way to make more than $60 a game since that isn\'t enough to pay for what modern AAA titles are. Everyone in this thread is talking about ""acting like adults"" without really acknowledging that this is all basically over the fact that people don\'t like the new Star Wars toy and are upset that other people are going to buy it. I feel no remorse for anyone who picks this game up only to realize how big of a shitshow it is, but in the end it\'s literally just a game. Personally I never minded paid DLC as long as the base game felt substantial since I know that devs need to make more money to cover the cost of these games and if I liked the base game it was normally worth it for me to pay a little extra for some extra content and play time. I agree that the loot boxes system in BF2 (and specifically the type that unlock key gameplay components, I think purely cosmetic loot boxes like in Overwatch are completely fine) is absurd but calling it gambling is a bit of a stretch, it\'s definitely a shitty business practice and totally hurts the consumer, but in terms of gambling it\'s maybe on par with buying a blind box toy where some toys are definitively better than others and chances are you\'re just going to be disappointed in your purchase. In the end just keep in mind that this is all over a game that is meant to be fun in your free time, so while it might be annoying if you get it only to realize that it\'s not as fun as you hoped, the world isn\'t over and that there will be plenty of other games that will be fun. For anyone who does get or has been burned by a situation like this, I recommend next time you buy a game wait a week or two to see what people think, and remember that if you wait a couple months you can normally pick these up for well under retail and maybe get 2 or 3 games for $60 rather than just one.\n\nedit: Also sidenote, is anyone actually that mad about being able to play as sequel characters in prequel settings and vice versa?

We‚Äôve done this with the closed alpha, through the beta last month, and our Play First Trial. And we continue to make adjustments based on your feedback as the game launches worldwide this week. Listening, and providing choices in how you play, will always be our principle with Star Wars Battlefront II. We want to ensure the game is balanced and fun both today and for years into the future.\n\nMaking games great comes from regular tuning. As one example, today we‚Äôre making a substantial change based on what we‚Äôve seen during the Play First trial. There‚Äôs been a lot of discussion around the amount of in-game credits (and time) it takes to unlock some of our heroes, especially Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader. Unlocking a hero is a great accomplishment in the game, something we want players to have fun earning. We used data from the beta to help set those levels, but it‚Äôs clear that more changes were needed. \n\nSo, we‚Äôre reducing the amount of credits needed to unlock the top heroes by 75%. Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader will now be available for 15,000 credits; Emperor Palpatine, Chewbacca, and Leia Organa for 10,000 credits; and Iden at 5,000 credits. Based on what we‚Äôve seen in the trial, this amount will make earning these heroes an achievement, but one that will be accessible for all players.\n\nIt's a big change, and it‚Äôs one we can make quickly. It will be live today, with an update that is getting loaded into the game.\n\nWe‚Äôve also been listening to how much you‚Äôre loving features in the game (Starfighter Assault, 40 player MP battles, Darth Maul lightsaber throws, etc.) as well as what you haven‚Äôt liked. We know some of our most passionate fans, including those in our subreddit, have voiced their opinions, and we hear you. We‚Äôre making the changes to the credit levels for unlocking heroes and we‚Äôre going to keep making changes to improve the game experience over time. We welcome the conversation.\n\nIn fact, this Wednesday we‚Äôd like you to join us for a Reddit AMA with some of the key leads on our team. Stay tuned to our social channels for more info on the AMA, and our blog for continual updates on what we‚Äôre seeing, hearing and adjusting in the game.\n\nFor those of you already playing, thank you. For those of you looking forward to playing the Star Wars‚Ñ¢ game you‚Äôve been waiting for, thank you, too. The team is fully committed to listening to our community, continually adjusting the game, and providing even more great Star Wars content over the upcoming months and years of live service updates.

Evangelicals have always had a hate-hate relationship with pop culture, but D&D panic became mainstream a little bit due to the general ""Satanic panic"" craze, as well as a specific case with James Dallas Egbert where lawmen incorrectly speculated D & D drove his behavior (a failed suicide attempt.) The old movie Mazes and Monsters is a fictionalized retelling of that case.\n\nThe Satanic Panic in general is something that tends to be forgotten now. People believed that there were cabals of satanists around that abused children and did other nasty things, due to a couple trials that heavily relied on the now discredited idea of repressed memories. This was mostly a secular idea. The meme joke ""show me on the doll where he touched you"" came from this, but was used along with leading questions to get vulnerable kids to confess to being abused in utterly bizarre and false ways. It\'s something that reads like it was straight out of fiction, but it really happened in the 1980s, and D&D was close enough to get hit in the crossfire from it.\n\nIt happened mostly as a reaction to the rise of mass media and the pretty harsh amount of social change we saw in the 80s. It\'s actually scarier that it was forgotten so quickly; if you grew up in that time, the fact that people literally thought it existed, and that it shaped pop culture in not a few ways, has always troubled me. It actually affected Christian fundamentalist belief in that it spawned the ""spiritual warfare"" trope and heightened belief in the existence and power of demons to influence people\'s behavior. A good example of this is in the novel ""This Present Darkness"" by Frank Peretti, which was my generation\'s Left Behind. And people actually milked this behavior; the Christian comedian Mike Warnke among others actually claimed to be ex satanists of the moral panic variety.\n\nIt\'s really a cautionary tale of how people act during times of social panic and what can set them off. It\'s not actually religion alone; religious people opposed the advent of the bar code, for one, and never saw the level of demonization at the secular level we did with D&D. (Though we do have to thank them for really linking bar codes with dehumanization, for example; sometimes religious critique can actually be dead on in emotional tone, while not on facts.) But if secular people on the whole are vulnerable, you get these ideas transmitted widespread.\n\nJust posting this if you think parents forbidding people from playing D&D is solely hyper religious nutcases. A lot of secular people fell for it too, and its too easy to fall into the idea that normal people can\'t fall prey to moral panic ideas.\n\n', 'My Bible teacher at my Christian School got me into D&D', 'Ha nerds', 'Enjoy your time in the [Fires of Hell](https://olddungeonmaster.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/fires-of-hell-5e.pdf), old man.', 'Is this starter set good?

The Bible stipulates the treatment of slaves, especially in the Old Testament. There are also references to slavery in the New Testament. Israelite slaves were to be offered release after six to seven years of service, with some conditions. A foreign slave could be bequeathed to the owner's family, and be made to serve for the life of the slave, except in the case of certain injuries.  \n\nI think case is closed for slavery. The Bible clearly promotes slavery.  \n\n[The Bible and homosexuality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bible_and_homosexuality).
