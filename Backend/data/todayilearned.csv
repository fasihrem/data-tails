A revelation that comes from the brilliance of my leadership and the guidance of our ancestors. I speak of something the world has kept from us for too long. Something they have coveted in secret. I speak, comrades, of *pizza.*\n\nThis is not just food. This is not just sustenance. *Pizza* is a powerful symbol of the abundance that the outside world tries to keep from us, but we will not be denied! Under my leadership, under the watchful eyes of our ancestors, we will bring this legendary creation to our homeland, and we will perfect it. For *pizza* will not be just a foreign luxury; it will become a proud symbol of our nation's culinary superiority!\n\nImagine, my people, a golden crust, baked to perfection, with ingredients chosen and controlled by our state to ensure the highest quality. The finest wheat grown in our own fields! The most perfect tomatoes, ripened by the rays of our glorious sun! Cheese, richer and more glorious than anything the world has ever known! This is what *pizza* is, and it will become a shining beacon of our nation's greatness.\n\nThe enemies of our people, those imperialist forces who seek to undermine our progress, have long hidden such wonders from us, but no longer! I have decreed the establishment of the *Supreme Pizza Initiative.* Factories will be built. Farms will be transformed. Every resource necessary will be directed toward the creation of this glorious food that the world has selfishly hoarded.\n\nThrough our unwavering dedication, we shall master the art of *pizza* making, and we shall surpass the world in our perfection of it. No longer will the outsiders be able to look down upon us. No longer will they hoard the luxuries of life! *Pizza* will be ours! And through this, our nation will rise to even greater heights of self-sufficiency and strength!\n\nLet this be a reminder to the world: whatever they try to deny us, we will take! Whatever they hide, we will uncover! Whatever they fear, we will master! This is the will of our people! This is the will of our nation!\n\nSo, as we move forward into this new era of abundance, remember that we, under my leadership, have the power to achieve anything. We shall eat the finest *pizza* on Earth, made by our own hands, and the world will bow before the glory of our innovation and strength!\n\nLet this be the day when we declare that no luxury is too great for our people. *Pizza* will become a symbol of our nation's unstoppable spirit!\n\nLong live our great nation!

They are judged by them.\n\nThis is why we condemn powerful people who go against those values (Commodus) and praise the ones who uphold or champion them (Lincoln.) \n\nAn individual is not the measure of a culture’s values. We do have broad, earnestly held values of being against slavery, against rape, and so on. That there are bad actors doesn’t change that. \n\nIn fact, if exactly 49.9% of all American adults did a rape today, that would still not invalidate the claim that America has a cultural value of being against rape. The majority still are against it, it’s still enshrined in law (a direct manifestation of culture), and there are still countless activist and support organizations for victims. \n\nAlso, I feel you are trivializing the sincerity of belief which is manifestly apparent in history. Read the Declaration of Independence very closely, it is an entire detailed argument for a set of values of rights as Natural Law, in the school of Locke, that was the result of years and years of deliberate, thoughtful debate, dialogue, and negotiation. \n\nPracticability and Ideology can and do coexist. Implementation is constrained by what is practicable, but practicability is only a necessary, not a sufficient, condition for a behavior to manifest. \n\nI could end all rape by killing all humans.

Me not killing everyone doesn’t mean I’m pro-rape. \n\nYou are equating the actions of a minority—criminals—to being the final authority on cultural value. \n\nEven your Sun Tzu reference betrays this. You are trying to paint him negatively by our perceived notions of compassion. Yet he is not claiming to show compassion, he’s not being dishonest. He is applying an observed truth about psychology to field doctrine. He’s not making a claim about if the particular war is justified or not, merely on how to effect victory in a given condition. \n\nIf you wish to project compassion into him, it’s just as easy to do so on the other side:\n\nPremise: Human death is undesirable \n\nPremise: Humans die in battles\n\nPremise: All humans are equal, so all deaths equally undesirable \n\nPremise: A commander is directly responsible for the lives of those under their command \n\n\nPremise: Sun Tzu’s assertion about leaving an Avenue of escape and his reason for it are correct (namely that men in a final stand will fight to the last man, resulting in the deaths of all defenders and many more attackers)\n\nConclusion: Generals ought to try to minimize the total deaths in a combat, with special emphasis on minimizing deaths of those under their command \n\nConclusion: **Generals are being compassionate** by leaving the Avenue of escape because while the number of defender deaths remains the same (more or less all of them) the number of attacker deaths are dramatically reduced. \n\nBut that’s equally as erroneous as your critique. It’s ascribing our cultural values onto a man massively removed from us in space, time, and socialization.', '[deleted]', 'Lincoln would still be a hero to the abolitionists, who may have all died.

Literally no one lived to write Boudicca’s ending, yet she is still a folk hero.\n\nJackson is worshiped by neoconfederates, and was a paragon of his culture. Only the culture of the union, and that of the confederacy, was incompatible. Separation was not an option, and so they fought. The war wasn’t wrong. Both sides earnestly believed they were right about how a government should run, and on what principles. The Confederates believed they had a right to secede, the Union believed this was theft and (especially after the Gettysburg address) that allowing the Confederacy to endure would be an unconscionable act of allowing slavery. (Interestingly slavery remained legal in some Union states for a few years after the war, until 13A was passed. History is complex and defies neat explanation like that.) \n\nThis is a logical necessity of the value of human dignity. If I believe you to truly be my equal, and I have beliefs I would die for, I must credit you with the dignity of your willingness to die for your beliefs being legitimate. When such beliefs come into competition, and they cannot be otherwise reconciled, war is the final arbiter. It is not fair, or desirable. But it can and has been inevitable. \n\nCicero‘s finest hour was his defeat and fall from power, remembered despite his opponent becoming one of the most powerful and beloved in his own time people in history: Emperor Augustus. It’s entirely possible for people to be remembered despite losing, and to have been cultural heroes. \n\nIt’s so possible it’s one of the great, eternal narrative tropes: Hector, brave Hector. \n\nYou’re projecting again on Sun Tzu. I never said he made a claim about compassion. I pointed out that your own argument could be used to say he was being compassionate, rather than merciless. \n\nIt is wrong to project one culture’s values onto the actions of another, it’s paternalistic and fundamentally ignores human dignity. I have no right to judge anyone in a totally separate culture by my values. The rise of the internet has accelerated the development of a global culture, but such values and ties are as yet nebulous. \n\nYou’re also drifting off topic. The claim is only that it is wrong to judge people in entirely separate cultures and times by our culture, and rather we should judge them by theirs. A counter claim to your assertion is that powerful people are judged by their culture’s standards, and that we cannot use individuals, but rather populations, to evaluate those cultural values.\n\nYou and I currently disagree, but we both clearly have the shared value of free discussion and the importance of well reasoned arguments. \n\nWomen as legitimate spoils of war was a commonly held cultural belief in the time and place of the Great Khan.

But that doesn’t magically metamorpihize him into an evil man. He upheld the values of his culture, taught to him from birth by his society, and left the world better by their standards. \n\nIf that is not admirable, what can any of us hope to achieve? All we strive for is to leave the world better, but better is always a culturally defined concept. I believe better means advocating the core values of American Culture—individualism, equality, liberty, and self-government.

However, it faced a very dangerous situation. \n\nOn one side, the Catholic Crusaders were coming. They were greedy for Novgorod's wealth. There had been some conflicts already, but it seemed the Crusaders were seriously going to go for it now.\n\nOn the other side, the Mongols were coming. The Russian principalities which had tried to fight, were destroyed completely. And now, they too, were coming for Novgorod. They were supported by the Kingdom of Denmark, who also had some ambitions on the rich Republic. \n\n\nSo what did Novgorod do? The Novgorod leaders called the exiled Prince Alexander Nevsky, the man they had excited themseleves. Nevsky organised and raised a force of levy troops to take on the professional Knight troops of the Crusaders. Nevsky fought hard and desperately. For him, Novgorod MUST not fall to the Crusaders. If Novgorod had fell, its population would have been slaughtered, and force converted to Catholicism. The city of Novgorod would be turned into a Crusader puppet, just like Constantinople was a few decades earlier.\n\nNevsky's efforts paid off, and he managed to drive the Crusaders away. The decisive battle was called the 'Battle on the Ice'. Nevsky's forces outnumbered the Crusader's forces by almost double, but while the Crusaders had heavy armour and Knight cavalry, Nevsky's forces were mainly peasant levy that were quickly raised. Still, they managed to defeat the Crusaders decisively and drive them out.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, what did Novgorod do about the Mongols? Well, they submitted to the Mongols. Nevsky, was aware that Novgorod could not take on both threats on their own. So he decided to choose submitting to the Mongol, rather than the Crusades. \n\nHis reasoning was simple. Under Mongol rule, Novgorod was essentially a tributary, but was left alone. The Mongols usually left their tributaries to do as they liked, and did not interfere in the local politics. As long as Novgorod was loyal and paid tributes. Another reason was, that as a tributary, Novgorod was now under the protection of the Mongols, which meant that the Crusaders could not launch any serious invasion attempts at them. In short, the Mongols only wanted tribute. \n\nOn the otherhand, the Crusaders were looking for a conquest. They aimed to destroy Novgorod, and take the Republic for their own.

The double standard will come back to bite everyone. Instead of debating shitty ideas and winning, these ideas are being censored and ultimately displaced to dark corners of the internet where they get worse. Fighting fox news garbage as ""fake news"" has turned into censoring all political ideas contrary to the approved narrative, and that leads to people getting their news from infowars and not believing in having a lockdown in a pandemic. I know a lot of this seems tangential but my point is that shitty ideas don\'t die with boomers and it\'s too late to think that it can be waited out, because young people are already adopting even further right ideas than boomers that they find on 4chan and other places that ostracized people go to connect, because they have become ostracized by a heavy handed ban-hammer-happy left.

In the Middle Ages when the feudal lords who inhabited the castles whose towers may still be seen along the Rhine concluded to enlarge their domains, to increase their power, their prestige and their wealth they declared war upon one another. But they themselves did not go to war any more than the modern feudal lords, the barons of Wall Street go to war. The feudal barons of the Middle Ages, the economic predecessors of the capitalists of our day, declared all wars. And their miserable serfs fought all the battles. The poor, ignorant serfs had been taught to revere their masters; to believe that when their masters declared war upon one another, it was their patriotic duty to fall upon one another and to cut one another's throats for the profit and glory of the lords and barons who held them in contempt. And that is war in a nutshell. The master class has always declared the wars; the subject class has always fought the battles. The master class has had all to gain and nothing to lose, while the subject class has had nothing to gain and all to lose — especially their lives.

Vietnam was the perfect example of this.\n\nedit : this comment was a bit lazy, go read below i wrote a wall article down there on the subject of discrimination in drafting https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/8ih4tq/til_that_in_1916_there_was_a_proposed_amendment/dysb8yq/', ""When my father was on the landing craft bound for Utah Beach on June 6, 1944, there wasn't a single black soldier in sight.\n\nNot the black soldiers' fault, of course, just pointing out the lack of history in your history."", 'I have no numbers and no time to source it for WW2 (edit : actually check below). For Vietnam War though there is a lot of papers about it.\n\n> African-Americans represented approximately 11 percent of the civilian population. Yet in 1967, they represented 16.3 percent of all draftees and 23 percent of all combat troops in Vietnam. In 1965, African-Americans accounted for nearly 25 percent of all combat deaths in Vietnam. ([source](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/18/opinion/racism-vietnam-war.html))\n\nAs stated in the article this difference dropped a little afterwards due mainly to the fact that the drafting system was changed to reduce inequities ( [source](https://thevietnamwar.info/vietnam-war-draft/) ). \n\nIt was also recorded that once this new drafting system was put in place, more and more Universities started going on strike (you can see that the timeline checks [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_protests_against_the_Vietnam_War#1967). White privileged people were risking a lot more to be drafted. Some historians attribute this shift to the starting point of global civil protest against the War.\n\nI highly recommend the very good documentary series about the vietnam war by Ken Burns that covers this subject in a very comprehensible way. In a way movies like Platoon also covers this, in a subtle but understandable way though.\n\nNow for the WW2 if i had the same quality of sources, i could argue with you. Now apparently the army officials used a logic to exclude black people from the draft in the account of ""racial intellectual limitations"". ([read more here](https://www.freedomarchives.org/Documents/Finder/Black%20Liberation%20Disk/Black%20Power!/SugahData/Essays/Murray.S.pdf))\n\nIt\'s very interesting to see how the critic of the drafting system in place during those wars laid a starting ground for a lot of Civil Rights Movements. \n\nAnyways. To answer more specifically your comment about your father serving on D-Day, it\'s probably that during WW2 army units were still segregated (which was no longer the case by 1948). There was a black contingent in the battle for Normandy that day, created from remaining troops of other units.\n\nSorry if my answer reads a bit overkill. I just find it interesting and had the time to share some of what i know :)\nAnd sorry for my lazy ass first comment. I tend to forget we are not twitter but on reddit man ! :D\n\nAlso let me conclude by saying : black, asians, latinos, white or whatever it does not really matter. It\'s the 99% who die in battle. The 1% does not go to war. But they are the one who declare it and takes profit out of it.

Many African Americans were happy and proud to volunteer for duty and they comported themselves with valor and dignity.\n\nThe truth is, in the relatively brief history of the United States, the skin color, such that it matters, of US combat deaths has been overwhelmingly white. \n\nAs for Vietnam, I see 49,824 dead white soldiers to 7,243 dead black soldiers. A roughly 7-1 ratio. The US population in 1970 was roughy 8 white people for every one black person. So the percentages were slightly higher for black soldiers in Vietnam.\n\nLooking at the numbers I never really see anything like South Park\'s ""Operation: Get Behind The Darkies."".', 'As i said, it varied amidst the course of the war ;)\nOne thing that is not reflected by only the numbers is where they were sent etc..compared to other folks.\n\n\nAlso it\'s ridiculous to talk about ""mostly white death"" in the US history.

Shaw carried a famous sword when he led his men into his final battle and this was depicted in the film Glory (1989).

On July 18, 1863, the regiment was ordered to spearhead an assault on Fort Wagner. Shaw was killed during the initial charge as he led his men into battle.\n\nWhile the assault was initially successful, Union forces were eventually pushed back and Confederate troops held on to the fort. Common practice at the time was for fallen officers to be given an honorable burial, regardless of the side they were on. However, as Shaw led the first all-black regiment, commanding Confederate General Johnson Hagood did not deem him worthy of that honor, stating\n\n>Had he been in command of white troops, I should have given him an honorable burial; as it is, I shall bury him in the common trench with the niggers that fell with him.\n\nUnion troops tried to recover his body and give him a proper burial, but were unsuccessful. Hearing of this, Shaw\'s father sent a letter to the regimental surgeon, stating:\n\n>We would not have his body removed from where it lies surrounded by his brave and devoted soldiers....We can imagine no holier place than that in which he lies, among his brave and devoted followers, nor wish for him better company. – what a body-guard he has!\n\nAnd so, the act considered by General Hagood to be an insult, came to be seen as the greatest honor that could have been bestowed upon Shaw.\n\n----\n\nThe story of Colonel Robert Gould Shaw and the 54th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment is memorialized in the film ""Glory"", starring Matthew Broderick as Shaw.', 'The Confederates thought it was an insult for Col.

What was conjecture with him, is now a realized fact. But whether he fully comprehended the great truth upon which that rock stood and stands, may be doubted. The prevailing ideas entertained by him and most of the leading statesmen at the time of the formation of the old Constitution were, that the enslavement of the African was in violation of the laws of nature; that it was wrong in principle, socially, morally and politically. It was an evil they knew not well how to deal with; but the general opinion of the men of that day was, that, somehow or other, in the order of Providence, the institution would be evanescent and pass away... Those ideas, however, were fundamentally wrong. They rested upon the assumption of the equality of races. This was an error. It was a sandy foundation, and the idea of a Government built upon it—when the ""storm came and the wind blew, it fell."" \n\n""Our new government is founded upon exactly the opposite ideas; its foundations are laid, its cornerstone rests, upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery, subordination to the superior race, is his natural and normal condition.

It may not have been articulated to be about that among common, everyday job-types in the Northern states but in Congress and on the political stump, this was the deciding issue. \n\nFurthermore, this issue had so flummoxed the Union that for 40 years, new and more convoluted laws were passed to maintain the institution of slavery despite the fact that the entire time this was happening, generations of Southern plantation owners and aristocracy had a deep-seeded fear that slavery would be abolished.  In essence, they felt it was always going to come to separation, or battle, or both. \n\nTo the specific point about the border states maintaining their state right to slavery during the time of the Civil War; this was done our political expediency. This clearly does not make it right but we know that this type of thinking does, in fact, happen in the halls of government. Basically, the Union knew that to abolish slavery at the outset would have forced all of the border states to immediately join the Confederacy. \n\nHad they done this, there was a real fear that the Confederacy would have been able to attack Ohio or Indiana and cut off what we call the upper-Midwest but what was then called The Northwest. This would have meant that Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, possibly Ohio, and the western territories would have been separated from the rest of the Union by an enemy in between them. \n\nAdded to this was the hope on the part of the federal government to keep other countries from recognizing the Confederacy as legitimate, which would have likely meant that the countries would remain forever separated. All of these factors informed the decision makers in Washington to determine the aforementioned expedient approach to the slavery question in those border states. \n\nIn a more general sense, except for a handful of outright abolitionists, most Americans who were against slavery did not see the races as equal in 1860. They found slavery to be an abomination but were as racist as their Southern counterparts in nearly all other aspects of life. To dispute this is to ignore the facts as they were. \n\nObviously, we have come some distance from how we interact and provide for equity among all Americans since that time. Still, we have much more distance to go in front of us and we would do well to remember this.\n\nThis is one of my favorite periods of American history and I have devoted a fair amount of time to its study.

Right away, it switched sides, as we can see from the fact that they pushed for the removal and extermination of Indians.

Because the sides were switched, the vast majority of Whig party were anti-slavery.\n\n(Eventually, there was rift in the party over the issue of slavery, and anti-slavery members of the Whig party, including Abraham Lincoln, exited the party and formed the Republican Party. As we can see, the parties must have switched again because it\'s common knowledge that republicans are actually the racist ones.)\n\nThen the parties switched when the democrats are on record as having mainly been the ones who owned slaves. Not all democrats owned slaves, but 100% of slaves were owned by democrats. Not a single republican in history owned a slave.\n\nAs we know, the parties switched again when republicans repudiated slavery and democrats defended it, leading to the civil war.\n\nThen the parties switched again when a democrat assassinated republican Lincoln.\n\nAfter the civil war, the parties switched again during the reconstruction era, when republicans attempted to pass a series of civil rights amendments in the late 1800s that would grant citizenship for freedmen. As evidence of the switch, the democrats voted against giving former slaves citizenship, but the civil rights amendments passed anyway.\n\nThe parties switched again when the Democratic Party members founded the KKK as their military arm. Democrats then attempted to pass the first gun control law in order to keep blacks from having guns and retaliating against their former owners. A county wanted to make it illegal to possess firearms, unless you were on a horse. (Hmmm wonder who rode around on horses terrorizing people 🤔). Gun control has always been a noble cause touted by democrats, but the racist reasons why the concept of gun control was dreamed up was a part of a party mentality switch, but not the actual party.\n\nSomewhere around this time former slaves fought for gun rights for all, and the NRA was formed. The NRA switched parties too when they defended the right for blacks to arm themselves and white NRA members protected blacks from racist attackers.\n\nThe parties switched again when republicans fought to desegregate schools and allow black children to attend school with white children, which democrats fought fiercely against.\n\nThe nation saw a rash of black lynchings and bombings of black churches by the democrats in the KKK and the parties switched again when Democrat Bull Conner tried to avoid prosecuting the racist bombers to get them off the hook. When blacks protested this injustice, the party-switched democrat Bull Conner sicced dogs and turned the hose on them. He also gave police stand down orders when the KKK forewarned attacks on the freedom riders, who had switched parties.\n\nThe parties switched again when a Democratic Party president appointmented the first and only KKK member to the Supreme Court.\n\nThe parties switched yet again when Democratic president FDR put Asians in racist internment camps.\n\nThen parties switched again when the democrats filibustered the passing of the second set of civil rights laws giving equal protection to minorities.\n\nThe parties switched when a democrat assassinated MLK.\n\nThis brings us to modern times.

I know that Lincoln would do anything to win his war. He started Federal taxes to pay for the war, he drafted blacks and immigrants, we fought to survive, he was going to kill every Southern and take over their land. General Lees home was taken over taxes and turned into Arlington cemetery to where his land would have no value. It was a bloody hell and no war fought over slaves, it was tariff laws and taxes, so Lincoln had no intention of freeing slaves. The confederate isn’t about slavery, most didn’t own any, most are common people that have children and as a family work the land. No one should ever own a person, their human beings, we had share crops and still do\n\nI don't understand this argument. I don't understand most of what she said. She implies Lincoln was trying to exterminate all Southerners for some abstract reason, but if the war was fought over tariffs and taxes... wouldn't killing taxpayers be bad? \n\nI dunno man. It seems like she's massively confused about the war. Then again, perhaps it's me that's confused. I'd like to know more and see where the facts lay, because as it is, I'm pretty sure this war began because of slaves, and I'm sure that even though not every single Confederate owned a slave, the Confederacy was a racist institution. \n\nAnybody willing to share their insight on this topic? "", 'I\'m reading""Battle Cry of Freedom"" by James McPherson, and it is a very good read.  I haven\'t finished yet, but the run up to the war was super fascinating.   \n\nThe short answer is what you would expect, the war was fought over slavery.  Not only that, but the South arguably pushed the issue by not being content with only having the slave states they did have.   Before secession it\'s arguable that the North would have left the south alone as long as slavery did not spread to any new states.   The south saw the writing on the wall, if more free states came into the Union without an equal amount of slave states, the Senate, the House of Reps and the government would eventually abolish slavery and the southern ""way of life"".  So yeah, racist pro-slavery reasons.  \n\nIt\'s true that most who fought for the South did not own slaves, but it is also true (according to this book) that support for the Confederacy lined up with areas with high slavery rates.   That is, in parts of the South with less slavery (like Appalachia) there was less support for secession and the Confederacy, and places where there were more slaves and plantations there was more support (even amongst non slave owners).   Slavery seems to have been intrinsically tied to the southern way of life so it seems foolish to argue that the war was fought over anything else.  You can paint is as economics or states\' rights  if you really want to to -- but the problem, the sticking point, the big issue that caused the south to secede from what it saw as ""Northern Aggression"" was Slavery.  Numerous states officially stated the reason for secession being the slavery issue, including statements about the ""superiority"" of the White race.\n\nThis is not to say that the North wasn\'t racist.  The whole damn country was incredibly racist.  But, there were no Frederick Douglasses of the South.  Both sides may have been full of racists, but only one side had racism purposely written into law, and it is the same side that caused slavery to be we written into the Constitution in the first place.   Truly, our national sin.\n\nEdit: But yes, the Union North began taxation and the IRS to support the war effort.   If you think taxation is the devil\'s work and is worse than enslaving people, then yeah, Lincoln was a real bad dude.   Contrary to popular belief, Lincoln was always anti-slavery as a person (he spoke about it years before becoming president) but he wasn\'t sure about emancipation until the South forced his hand.   As president he said he just wanted to preserve the union and the south could keep slavery if they would stop trying to expand it.  They would not stop trying, so then Lincoln realized (maybe over the course of a year or two of war) that there was no union possible with slavery.

There was also the notion that if the Federal government as a contract *between* sovereign states, broke the rules of the Constitution, sovereign states would have the right to break that contract and declare independence.

The Free states were not going to admit a single new slave state into the union and it was causing strife. The south very much went to war with slavery as one of the major grievances.

The reason Lincoln didn't pass the Emancipation Proclamation until he did was that he couldn't afford to alienate the slave owning border states, because if they had left the Union, the North wouldn't have stood a chance.

That\'s why we should\'ve outlawed slavery in the original draft of the Constitution, so it wouldn\'t have been an institution in the first place. Yes, it would\'ve severely destabilized us as a country and may have even led to an earlier civil war, but we would\'ve recovered from it, probably much quicker and better than we did from the actual civil war.\n\nAs a nation we allowed slavery to take hold for far too long and because of that we were one of the last First-world countries to abolish it. Even then, we didn\'t truly abolish it until the 60s. There were still laws in place barring black Americans from their fundamental rights as citizens of the United States. Like, say, the Jim Crow Laws? ""Oh sure, you can vote, but first you need to graduate from a school that only accepts white students."" ""Oh sure, you can get paid for work, in the form of paying off minuscule portions of the ridiculously large debts you owe us."" Separate but equal my ass.\n\nThis is an important issue.

I think that had a civil war happened back then, it would\'ve gone similarly to how it actually happened, though likely with less bloodshed on both sides.\n\nFor one thing, they\'d just finished winning the revolution, so nobody would really want to fight any longer than they felt was necessary. Also, technology had not advanced as far, so killing would have been slower than with, say, gatling guns.\n\nSecond, Britain and France would be too unstable to provide aid to the south, as they did in the actual civil war, albeit on the down-low, since they valued the south\'s cotton exports but didn\'t want to openly condone slavery.\n\nThere\'s also the fact that there would have been less time for the south to become both reliant on and proud of their ""rights"" to own slaves. Even in the real civil war, many of the confederate soldiers were not slave-owners themselves. But all of them believed owning slaves was a right and that blacks were inherently inferior to whites. This was in part due to the mindset that had developed and been reinforced over decades of it being the status quo. It certainly didn\'t help that those who owned slaves were usually wealthy, and therefore looked upon with respect and authority, so when they said something was true, many less wealthy, non-slave-owning citizens believed them.\n\nFurthermore, once the hypothetical earlier civil war ended, there would have been more time for reconstruction, recovery, and adaption to the new way. This would have led to a faster decline in racism and greater prosperity for all Americans by the time the industrial revolution came around. This in turn would have started a trend of acceptance in the US, not just of blacks, but of all peoples; Jews, gays, Asians, etc.\n\nBecause of this, it would have been much harder to attribute acts of violence and terror to entire groups of people, and they would instead be viewed as they are: a few bad people making a large, horrible impact.

IN the US, it\'s a program started in the 50\'s to get dads spending more time with their kids (and really probably a way to monetize the camp sites in the winter). So three campouts a year, the dads got waaaaay into it - food, good cocktails around the fire when the kiddos crashed, horseback riding, canoes, hiking. Those campouts were bigger than christmas for our kids. So with 2 girls and a boy, and one ""graduating"" to the more hardcore camping group, I ended up doing 9 campouts every school year. \n\nSo we put flyers in the school papers, wanted to give every dad a shot at it.

What are you talking about?\n\nEdit: I responded to him but he apparently threw a tantrum and deleted his comment (telling us all to keep getting ""cucked""): \n\nHere\'s my response: \n\n>The Tender Years Doctrine the basis of our current system which says that default custody should be given to the mothers. It was created by feminists back in the late 1800\'s and is still used in most of the world. \n\nThis is just historically incorrect. The TYD was created to *give* mothers rights to their children during divorce proceedings, because the system in place prior to that defaulted custody to men since they were the only ones who could afford to care for them. This is actually worse than it sounds because even in cases where fathers were neglecting or abusing their children, mothers had virtually no recourse to gain custody. The law that the British Parliament passed *could* grant default custody to women if their children were seven years old or younger, but it was ultimately up to the judge\'s discretion. It wasn\'t until almost 40-years-later that, unprompted, Parliament extended the age to 16. I think we can all agree that defaulting custody is wrong regardless of gender, but surely the overall idea (while deeply flawed) was a step in a better direction than what was previously in place. \n\n>It could be said that the Act was not so much concerned with the welfare of the child as with the punishment of the mother proved ""guilty"" in separation or divorce proceedings .... But in 1839, the Custody of Infants Act constituted an immense and startling innovation: the absolute right of the father was now subject to the discretionary power of the judge .... Under the Act the practice of the courts was to decide if possible in favour of paternal right rather than against it, and to exercise discretion against the mother even as to young children. Nevertheless, despite its limitations, this piece of legislation has a special importance since it was the first statutory intervention in the common law rights of a father in this country.\n\n[Source](https://scholarship.law.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1528&context=jchlp)\n\n> There is also the National Organisation of Women, the largest feminist org in the US, who explicity state to be against equal custody rights on their website. \n\nWhat you\'re talking about is their position regarding *forced* shared custody laws; not voluntarily agreements/mediated arrangements between parents. There\'s actually some research out there that shows forced shared custody laws have long-term negative impacts on children, because more often than not it creates ongoing conflict between the parents which is then transferred to the children. This argument splits both ways...for mothers and fathers, so I\'m not entirely sure why you would have an issue with it.

And, I may have toned down my views slightly in order to make the discussion easier, mainly because some of them don't make sense outside of a specific context – seems unfair to judge someone for not taking 8 months of paternity leave when that'd certainly lead to them losing their job.\n \n\n\nI'd like to make clear that I do think that making money is an important part of caring for your family. I just thought it was quite clear that my comment was about physical parenting and found the numerous responses kind of nitpicking in an annoying way. \n\n\nI'm not likely to criticise anyone for being career-focused. I've an advanced education and I'm pretty sure I'll always love my job. My main point is that it *is* possible for two people with kids to both have successful careers, but only if they share childcare and other housework. I find the idea of a stay at home parent pretty crazy. Instead, an ideal situation for me would be 1-2 years of shared parental leave after birth, and then potentially a few years of mutual part-time after that.  I'll say that I do believe there's more personal gain for the breadwinner in a breadwinner–stay at home parent type of set up. They're ultimately in charge of the money and as such, many aspects of family life. This might be biased by the fact that I find the idea of being a stay at home mom mindblowingly boring. \n\n\nA few words of my background that make might make you understand where I'm coming from: my parents divorced when I was nine because when my dad lost his job, he couldn't abandon his 50s-inspired ideals and expected my mom to still take responsibility for kids&home while still working full time in an advanced, qualified job. Unsurprisingly, that didn't last. Luckily I live in a country where shared custody is default and I spent 10 years living every other week with each parent. However, it became quite clear that my dad had a hard time catching up when it came to both the emotional but mainly the practical aspects of parenting. My brother and I always preferred living with my mom but never said anything as it obviously would have been very hurtful. I love my dad but there's no doubt that he's suffered for not putting in as much effort in learning the emotional support bit. I do believe most people can learn, and I think everyone deserves better than to always be the second parent, so to speak. That's why I think both parents should be involved in the physical aspect of parenting – for their spouse's sake, for their kid's sake but very much for their own sake, especially in case of a divorce. \n\nI am having a hard time seeing my values as anything but objectively superior – a human fallacy, I guess.

The property I live on is waterfront and has been in my family at least since my great grandfather. I\'m not sure if he purchased or inherited it, but either way, back then it wasn\'t a tourist area and land values were pretty low because it\'s essentially just swamp and marsh. My great grandfather left this land in his will to his 4 children. 3 of them moved away and have most likely passed away by now, just like my grandfather, but he stayed in the house my great grandfather built on the property and continued paying taxes and keeping up the land, and since his death that burden has been passed on to my family. He had one child, my father, who has also passed away. My paternal grandmother, however, is still somehow alive, presumably through some pact with the devil.\n\nSince the land is technically split between 4 families, the children and grandchildren of my great grandfather still legally have a stake in it. We can\'t sell it or build permanent structures on it without the other relatives, most of which I have never met, agreeing to sign it over to us. Nobody in my family bothered to even try until my sister a few years back hired a lawyer well versed in property rigout. The fact we\'ve been paying taxes and upkeeping the property apparently means nothing and we can\'t force the other members to pay for their share of the taxes nor can we claim that it\'s ours after all these years. All relatives except for one agreed to simply sign it over to us. The one that refused would need to be bought out. Unfortunately, the tourism boom that started in the \'80s and drove land prices astronomically high makes that impossible for our family.\n\nI live in a mobile home on the land.

He can\'t deal with the insurance companies anymore because a lot of the work is done electronically, so that all falls down to me. It is just me and him here, and dealing with car parts can\'t always be handled by oneself, especially not by an old man in his late 70s.
